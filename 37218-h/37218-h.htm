<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="in">A standard modern history of the English novel speaks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i" id="Page_i">i</a></span>
"the appearance of the novel round about 1700. Nothing that
preceded it in the way of prose fiction can explain it."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> Though
today many scholars would assert that "nothing" is too strong a
term, just how much of the original fiction written under the later
Stuarts could "explain" Defoe and Richardson? Most late seventeenth-century
novels, it is true, are rogue biographies, scandal-chronicles,
translations and imitations of French <i>nouvelles</i>, or
short sensational romances of love, intrigue, and adventure with
fantastic plots and wooden characters. Only occasionally was
a tale published which showed that it was not examples of the
novelist's craft that were wanting to inspire the achievement of
a Defoe, but rather the sustained application of that craft over
hundreds of pages by the unique combination of talents of a
Defoe himself.</p>

<p class="in">Such a novel is <i>Olinda's Adventures</i>, a brief epistolary
narrative of 1693, a minor but convincing demonstration of the
theory that a literary form such as the novel develops irregularly,
by fits and starts, and of the truism that a superior mind can
produce superior results with the most seemingly ungrateful
materials. Of Defoe, <i>Olinda's Adventures</i> must appear a modest
precursor indeed; but measured, as a realistic-domestic novel,
against the English fiction of its day, it is surprisingly mature;
and if we believe the bookseller and assign its authorship to a
girl of fourteen, we must look to the juvenilia of Jane Austen
for the first comparable phenomenon.</p>

<p class="in"><i>Olinda's Adventures</i> seems to owe what success it had entirely
to the bookseller Samuel Briscoe. It appeared in 1693 in
the first volume of his epistolary miscellany <i>Letters of Love
and Gallantry and Several Other Subjects</i>. <i>All Written by Ladies</i>,
the second volume following in 1694.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> It may have been the
nucleus of the collection, however, since it begins the volume,
and since Briscoe states in "The Bookseller to the Reader"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">ii</a></span>(sig. A2) that various ladies, hearing that he was going to print
Olinda's letters, have sent in amorous correspondence of their
own&mdash;a remark that could indicate some previous circulation in
manuscript. Another edition (or issue) of the miscellany, with
a slightly altered title, was advertised in 1697, but no copy of
this is recorded.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> Nothing further is heard of <i>Olinda</i> for some
years, but meanwhile Briscoe became something of a specialist
in popular epistolary miscellanies, perhaps because he was a
principal employer of Tom Brown, much of whose output consisted
of original and translated "familiar letters." In 1718
Briscoe assembled a two-volume epistolary collection with the
title <i>Familiar Letters of Love, Gallantry and Several Occasions</i>;
this collection was apparently made up of the best and most
popular items in his miscellanies of the past twenty-five years.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>
Here <i>Olinda</i> appears in much more impressive company than the
anonymous "ladies," for the collection includes the first letter
of Heloise to Abelard (said to be translated by L'Estrange) with
actual correspondence and epistolary fiction by Butler, Mrs.
Behn, Dennis, Otway, Etherege, Dryden, Tom Brown, Mrs. Mary
Manley, Farquhar, Mrs. Centlivre, and other wits. Another edition
(or issue) was advertised for W. Chetwood in 1720; and if
the edition of 1724 ("Corrected. With Additions") is really the
sixth, as Briscoe's title-page states, <i>Olinda</i> must have reached
a respectable number of readers.</p>

<p class="in"><i>Olinda</i> enjoyed another distinction, nearly unique for English
popular fiction before 1700. While by the middle of the
eighteenth century novel-readers in France were reveling in
the adventures of the English epigones of Pamela and Clarissa,
defending their virtue or exhibiting their sensibility in translation,
the current of literary influence before Defoe ran overwhelmingly
in the opposite direction. <i>Olinda</i> anticipated the Miss
Sally Sampsons of sixty years later by appearing in 1695 in a
French translation as <i>Les Amours d'une belle Angloise: ou la
vie et les avantures de la jeune Olinde: Ecrites par Elle mesme
en forme de lettres à un Chevalier de ses amis</i>.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> Whether merit
or mere chance accounted for this unusual occurrence it is impossible
to say; the translation of <i>Olinda</i> is a faithful one,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">iii</a></span>though the text is at times expanded by the insertion of poems
into Olinda's letters, with brief interpolated passages which
rather awkwardly account for their presence. Curiously, the
volume closes with a list of books printed for Briscoe, indicating
either that the French translator would do anything to fill up
space, or that Briscoe may have been exploring the possibilities
of a French market for his wares.</p>

<p class="in">While <i>Olinda</i> was ascribed merely to an anonymous "young
lady" in the first edition, the editions of 1718 and 1724 gave it
to "Mrs. Trotter." This lady, who since 1707 had been the wife
of the Reverend Patrick Cockburn, a Suffolk curate, was then
living in relative obscurity (her husband, having lost his living
at the accession of George I, was precariously supporting his
family by teaching), though she had enjoyed a certain literary
success in King William's time and would later be heard from as
a "learned lady" and writer on ethics. The fact that her maiden
name was used, though not likely in 1718 to add very much luster
to Briscoe's collection, and the similarities between the heroine's
situation and Mrs. Trotter's own early life (to be discussed
later) make Briscoe's attribution seem worthy of acceptance. It
is true that if Mrs. Trotter wrote <i>Olinda</i> she did it at fourteen.
But she had been a child of astonishing precocity; she had produced
a successful blank-verse tragedy at sixteen, and both Lady
Mary Wortley Montagu and Jane Austen were to perform similar
novelistic feats (to say nothing of Daisy Ashford).</p>

<p class="in">Catherine Trotter (1679-1749)<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> was the daughter of David
Trotter, a naval commander who died on a voyage in 1683, and
Sarah Bellenden (or Ballenden), whose connections with the
Maitland and Drummond families seem to have helped support
her and her daughter in genteel poverty until she gained a pension
of £20 per year under Queen Anne; Bishop Burnet was also
her friend and patron. Catherine, a child prodigy, learned Latin
and logic, and is said to have taught herself French; she extemporized
verses in childhood, and at fourteen composed a poem
on Mr. Bevil Higgons's recovery from the smallpox which is no
worse than many "Pindarics" of the period. In 1695, however,
Catherine Trotter established herself as a female wit with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">iv</a></span>impressive success of her tragedy <i>Agnes de Castro</i>, adapted
from Mrs. Behn's retelling of an episode from Portuguese history.
It was produced at the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane in
December, with a prologue by Wycherley and with Mr. and Mrs.
Verbruggen and Colley Cibber in the cast. <i>The Fatal Friendship</i>,
a tragedy produced at Lincoln's Inn Fields in 1698, had a
moderate success; two later plays did not. But Mrs. Trotter
gained the acquaintance of Congreve, Dryden, and Farquhar,
and was well enough known to be lampooned in <i>The Female
Wits</i> (1704; acted 1696) along with Mrs. Pix and Mrs. Manley.
In 1702 she turned to more serious writing, and her <i>Defence of
the Essay of Humane Understanding</i> and other treatises defending
Locke's theories against the charge of materialism were impressive
enough to earn her a flattering letter from Locke himself;
she also corresponded with Leibniz, who analyzed her
theories at some length. <i>The History of the Works of the Learned</i>
printed an essay of hers on moral obligation in 1743, and in 1747
Warburton contributed a preface to one of her treatises.</p>

<p class="in">If we are willing to admit that <i>Olinda</i> is Mrs. Trotter's work,
its virtues may be explained in part by seeing it as romanticized
autobiography. Olinda, like Mrs. Trotter, is a wit and something
of a beauty in adolescence, a fatherless child living with a prudent
mother who is anxious to marry her off advantageously, and
a solicitor of favors from noble or wealthy connections. Of the
details of her character and circumstances at this time, however,
no information is certain, and we must rely upon two presumably
biased contemporary portraits. Mrs. Trotter gets off lightly in
<i>The Female Wits</i>; she is represented (in "Calista," a small role)
as being somewhat catty and pretentious, vain of her attainments
in Latin and Greek (she has read Aristotle in the original, she
says), but her moral character is not touched upon.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> Another
account of her early life, in Mrs. Manley's fictionalized autobiography
and scandal-chronicle, <i>The Adventures of Rivella</i>
(1714), may be entirely unreliable; but its author was certainly
well acquainted with Mrs. Trotter, and what she says of her life
in the 1690's, what is narrated in <i>Olinda</i>, and what Mrs. Trotter's
scholarly memoirist Thomas Birch relates are similar in outline,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">v</a></span>similar enough so that we may speculate that the same set of
facts has been "improved" in <i>Olinda</i>, perhaps maliciously distorted
in <i>Rivella</i>. Cleander, the Platonic friend of the novel,
Orontes, the kidnapped bridegroom, and Cloridon, the inconveniently
married noble lover, appear to be three aspects of
the same person; for Mrs. Manley tells at length (pp. 64-71) of
"Calista's" relationship with "Cleander" (identified in the "key"
to <i>Rivella</i> as Mrs. Trotter and Mr. Tilly).<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> John Tilly, the
deputy warden of the Fleet prison, whose mistress Mrs. Manley
became and remained until 1702, first met her, she says, through
Mrs. Trotter, who sought her aid in interceding with her cousin
John Manley, appointed chairman of a committee to look into
alleged misdemeanors of Tilly as prison administrator. Mrs.
Trotter, says Mrs. Manley, was a prude in public, not so in private;
she was the first, "Cleander" said, who ever made him
unfaithful to his wife. Mrs. Manley goes on, with a tantalizing
lack of clarity (pp. 101-102):</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[Calista's] Mother being in Misfortunes and indebted
to him, she had offered her Daughter's Security, he
took it, and moreover the Blessing of one Night's
Lodging, which he never paid her back again....
[Calista] had given herself Airs about not visiting
<i>Rivella</i>, now she was made the Town-Talk by her
Scandalous Intreague with <i>Cleander</i>.</p></div>

<p class="in">Whatever the truth about Mrs. Trotter's adolescent amours
may have been, or whether they have any connection with Olinda's
fictional ones, must remain a matter for speculation; but the artistic
merits of <i>Olinda</i> are in no such doubt. Although technically
it may be called an epistolary novel, its author is no Richardson
in marshalling the strategies of the epistolary technique. Nevertheless,
although it is actually a fictional autobiography divided
somewhat arbitrarily into "letters," the postponement of the letter
to Cloridon until the end, the introduction of what might be called
a subplot as Olinda tries to promote Cleander's courtship of
Ambrisia and notes its progress, the breaking off of the letters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>at moments of (mild) suspense, the bringing up of the action to
an uncompleted present, all these show an awareness of fictional
mechanics that is far from elementary. Indeed, a contemporary
critic might go so far as to see in the novel's conclusion
an anticipation of the "open-ended" realism of plotting so
much applauded at present; for though Orontes has been got out
of the way, Olinda has not yet been rewarded with Cloridon's
hand by a similarly happy turn of fate, and must patiently await
the demise of his inconvenient wife as anyone outside of melodrama
might have to do. The contretemps and misunderstandings,
the trick played on Olinda with regard to Cloridon's fidelity and
her subsequent undeceiving, the closet-scene and its embarrassments,
may smack of the hackneyed devices of stage comedy,
but they are not clumsily handled, and they never make emotional
mountains out of molehills.</p>

<p class="in">Perhaps the most salient qualities of <i>Olinda</i>, in contrast to
the fiction of its day, are restraint and control. With the exception
of the rather ridiculous way in which the complications are
resolved at the end (Orontes's sequestration and death from
smallpox), everything in the novel is planned and motivated with
some care. Inclinations develop slowly and believably; the
springs of action, barring a few not very fantastic coincidences
and accidents, are anti-romantic&mdash;almost too much so. Indeed,
such criteria of the "modern novel" as those proposed by Ian
Watt<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> are all modestly but adequately met. Most important, the
situation and behavior of the heroine, her values, and the world
in which she lives are (but for their sketchy development) what
a reader of Jane Austen might take for granted, yet are all but
unique before 1740.</p>

<p class="in">Here is a middle-class heroine who is fully as moral as
Pamela, but with a wry sense of humor; she defers to her mother
as a matter of course when marriage is in question, yet would
willingly evade parental decrees; she is capable of Moll Flanders's
examinations of motive, yet sees through her own hypocrisies;
she lives in London in reduced circumstances and agrees
to a marriage of convenience although tempted to engage in a
dashing adultery; and she endures the onset of both love and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">vii</a></span>jealousy without melodramatic or sentimental posturings.</p>

<p class="in">Other technical achievements of <i>Olinda</i> aside, the portrait
of the heroine as she reveals herself to her confidant is the
novel's most significant feature. A fictional heroine of this
early date who can be sententious without being tedious, who
is moderately and believably witty, who is courted by a goldsmith
(even though, conformably to the times, he is named
Berontus) rather than a prince borrowed from <i>Astrée</i>, and who
satirizes herself soberly for scorning him, who meets her ideal
lover with a business letter rather than in a shipwreck, and who
level-headedly fends him off because he is both married and a
would-be philanderer, is a rarity indeed.</p>

<p class="in"><i>Olinda</i> commends itself to the student of English literary
history principally for two reasons: because it so ably anticipates
in embryo so many features which the English domestic
and realistic novel would develop in its age of maturity and
popularity, and because we do not yet understand, and need to
investigate, the cultural factors&mdash;literary, social, and economic&mdash;which
prevented the kind of achievement it represents from being
duplicated with any frequency for several decades.</p>

<span class="hidden">I</span> Hope I need not tell you how uneasie
this tedious Absence makes me; for
I must confess as troublesome as I
find it, and as much as I Value you,
I can't but wish you may be able to
guess at it by what you suffer your
self: A strange Effect of the highest
degree of Friendship; for if I had less for you, I
shou'd not so earnestly desire to hear you are in
Pain; but such Contradictions are no Mysteries to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>you, who understand so well the little Niceties of
Friendship. That you may see I study nothing
more in this Solitude than to oblige you; I've resolv'd
to employ most part of my time in complying
with that Request you've often made me, of
giving you a particular account of all that has
happen'd to me in my Life; tho' I fear I shall
lose part of that Esteem which you have hitherto
preserved for me, by acquainting you with some
Passages of it, which yet I hope have nothing in
'em so ill, that the kindness of a Friend mayn't
find out something in the Circumstances of the
Story to Excuse: For tho' perhaps I have not always
been so nicely cautious as a Woman in strictness
ought, I have never gone beyond the bounds
of solid Virtue. To put all to the hazard then, I
will give you a faithful Account of all my Weaknesses.
My Father dying, left me when I was very
young, to the Tuition of a Mother, who as you
know is qualify'd for such a Charge equal to any
of her Sex; and she indeed perform'd her part as
well as her small Fortune wou'd permit her, which
was scarce sufficient to maintain her, in that Rank
her Birth had placed her. However, she gave me
all the Education that was necessary; but I believe
you'll excuse me if I pass over all that occurr'd
till I was Thirteen, for about that time I began
to fancy my self a Woman, and the more to perswade
me to it, I happen'd to be acquainted with
a Gentleman whose Name was <i>Licydon</i>, who the
first or second time I saw him, seem'd to have so
much confidence in me, that he told me a long
story of his Love, and ever after shew'd me all the
Letters he either Writ to, or received from his
Mistress: This you must think did not a little
please me. and I thought my self as Wise as the
Gravest Politician, when he ask'd my Advice in
any of his Affairs, especially when I heard him
commended by many for a Man of great Parts.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>One day that we were by our selves, we fell into
a Discourse of Womens making Love; he Argu'd
that 'twas very unjust to deprive 'em of the satisfaction
of discovering a Passion, which they were
as much subject to as Men: I said as much against
him as I cou'd, but he had more dexterity to manage
his Argument than I; so that I was easily
brought to agree with him; but said 'twas well
that custom was observ'd, since the complaisance
which was paid by their Sex to ours, would sometimes
oblige 'em to comply contrary to their Inclination;
for I cou'd not imagine how they cou'd
civily refuse a Lady's Intreaties. He told me if
I wou'd write a Declaration of Love to him, he
wou'd shew me how it might be Answer'd with a
great deal of Respect, without any Love. I consented
to do it, and accordingly did the next day,
and he return'd me an Answer which satisfied me:
This, tho' it may seem a trivial thing, you will
find by the sequel, had like to have produc'd but
ill Effects. Some time after this, he brought a
Friend of his to Visit us, who was of a good Family;
but according to the <i>English</i> custom of breeding the
younger Sons to Trades; he was a Goldsmith, but
a great <i>Beaux</i>, and one who seem'd to have a Soul
above his calling: He ask'd <i>Licydon</i> if he had any
pretensions to me, which when he assur'd him he
had not, he told him he was very glad he had not
a Rival in a Friend; for he was hugely smitten,
and shou'd need his Assistance in his design; for
he had observ'd such an intimacy between us, as
gave him Reason to think he had great influence
over me; and he was sure he wou'd not deny him,
if he was not my Lover. <i>Licydon</i> assur'd him he had
only a Friendship for me, and that he wou'd use all his
Credit with me to perswade me to receive all His Addresses
favourably; which he did as soon as he had
an opportunity. He said all of him that he could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>imagine most engaging, and especially of the Violence
of his Passion. I was well enough pleas'd
with the Love, tho' not with the Lover; for 'tis
natural at that unthinking Age to covet a croud of
Admirers, tho' we despise them: But I believe I
need not confine that Vanity to Youth, many of
our Sex are troubled with it, when one wou'd
think they were Old enough to be sensible of the
Folly, and inconvenience of being continually
Courted, and haunted by Men they have an indifference,
or perhaps an aversion for For my part
I think there is no greater Torment; but I was of
another Opinion then, and therefore Rally'd at the
Love, and seem'd not to <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: should be 'believe'">blelieve</span> it; which I warrant
you gave great Encouragement to my new
Lover, when he heard of it; for 'tis a great Sign
one wou'd be convinc'd. So I'd best prepare my
self for an Attack, which I did not expect long: It
was begun by a <i>Billet Doux</i>, which came first to my
Mother's Hands; and when she gave it me, she ask'd
what Answer I wou'd return. I told her I was
wholly to be Govern'd by her; but if I was to
follow my own inclination I wou'd not answer it
at all: My Mother reply'd, she thought it fit I
shou'd Answer it; for she believ'd I cou'd have no
aversion to him, and she did not think it an ill
Match, considering my Circumstances. Then I
desir'd her to indite a Letter for me, for I saw well
enough I shou'd not please her. She gave me a
Copy of one, that without saying any thing that
was kind, gave him cause enough to despair; but
I cou'd not dissemble my Looks and Actions, in
which he observ'd so much Coldness, that tho' several
Letters pass'd between us, that wou'd have
given hopes to a Man the least apt to presume;
he was often half an hour with me alone, without
speaking one Word to me. At last he complain'd
to <i>Licydon</i> of the strange contradictions in what I
did, and what I Writ; for whenever he begun to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>speak to me of his Love, I check'd him with such severe
Looks, and turn'd the Discourse in such a
manner, that he durst proceed no further, tho' my
Letters seem'd much to his Advantage. <i>Licydon</i>
perswaded him (as perhaps he thought himself) that
'twas only my Modesty, and that perhaps I shou'd
be more emboldned, if he cou'd get my Mother's
consent to his Proposals. <i>Berontus</i>, for that was
his Name, was as well satisfy'd with this, as if I
had told him so my self; and away goes he immediately
to my Mother, and tells her he's stark staring
mad in Love with her Daughter: The next
thing they talk of is Joynture, and Settlements, <i>&amp;c.</i>
and in fine they agree; So I am call'd for, and
commanded to look upon this Spark as one that
must shortly be my Husband; to give us the more
freedom, my Mother leaves us together. 'Well,
Madam, (says he) I have no Opposites to struggle
with, your Mother has given me her consent,
and you have given me hopes that you will not
refuse me yours. What shou'd I do in this perplexity?
I had a firm Resolution never to Marry
him; but I found my Mother so much set upon it,
that I durst not let it be known; besides, I had engag'd
my self so far in Obedience to her, that I
did not know how to come off; but for the present
I wou'd be whimsical, and take time to consider
what I shou'd do hereafter. So I put on a pet, and
said, <i>Berontus</i>, I don't know what advantage you
think you have more than before; but I'm sure
a Lover wou'd have found another way of Courting
his Mistress, than by her Mother; and it may
be you'll find your self never the nearer my Heart
for having gain'd her: I hate a Man that will depend
upon any other for my Favour than my self.
'Cruel Creature, <i>says he</i>, what pleasure do you
take in tormenting me? You know that I love
you with the greatest respect imaginable, and
that I can't be happy but by you alone. I never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>had Recourse to your Mother till you had encourag'd
me, and gave me leave to say it; your
usage of me is very unjust. I knew well enough
he was in the Right; but I wou'd not know it:
So that we parted both much dissatisfied. How
his Thoughts were employ'd I can't pretend to
tell you; but I was continually contriving how to
get out of this troublesome Affair. I cou'd find
no way but to tell him sincerely, that all that I
had writ in his favour was by constraint; that I
was too young to think of Love, or Marriage, and
so trust to his Generosity; and prevail with him,
if possible, to let it fall of his side. The first time
I had an opportunity of putting my design in Execution,
I thought the poor Lover wou'd never
have liv'd to see me beyond those Years which
serv'd for a pretence for my refusal; but he was
Wise enough to baulk me, 'If, <i>says he</i> (after he
was come out of his Dumps; for he was a quarter
of an hour without saying any thing. You see he
was much given to silence) 'If I did not imagine
it your Hate that only study'd an Excuse, I
shou'd wait with a great deal of satisfaction, till
you were pleas'd to make me happy: But as it
is, I shall die a thousand times with fear, that
some other more happy in your inclinations than
I, will rob me of you for ever. He said in fine,
abundance of fine things, to perswade me to engage
my self to him; but I wou'd not consent to
it; and all I could say to him, was as little prevalent
to make him desist his suit. He wou'd wait
the Patriarch's Prenticeship rather than lose his Angel:
Would it not be a sad Business if he should
lose her after all? But I am afraid he's like, for
her thoughts cannot be brought so low; they towre
a little above his Shop, perhaps too high for her
Fortune; but she's something too young to consider
that, or to prefer her Interest to her Humour.
But to go on with my Story; my Mother was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>well enough satisfied to have the Match delay'd;
so that I thought I had nothing to do for a Year
or two, but to wish some Accident might intervene
to hinder it. But it was not long before a
Servant we had in the House found me other Employment;
I had complain'd of some Negligences
she had been guilty of, when my Mother was out
of Town, which were occasion'd by a fondness she
had for one that waited upon <i>Licydon</i>: Upon
which she had been like to be turn'd away, and
being of a revengeful Spirit, she cou'd never forgive
it. She had observ'd, that <i>Licydon</i> often gave me,
and I him, Letters in private; for when he had
no other opportunity, he us'd to give me those he
sent, or receiv'd from his Mistress, as we were taking
leave, when I conducted him to the Door;
which I often did, whilst my Mother was entertaining
other Company; and I return'd 'em when
I saw him again. This malicious Wench hoping
to find something in 'em that might prejudice me,
to <i>Licydon</i>'s Man (over whom it seems she had a
great Influence) that she heard his Master was a
great Poet, and that she had a great mind to see
some of his Works, if he could contrive to let her
into his Closet when he was abroad: The Servant
who suspected nothing, promis'd her he wou'd let
her know the first time his Master left his Key,
which he very seldom did. He kept his Word
with her, and after she had look'd over all his Papers,
at last she found that Letter which I spoke
of at the beginning. She knew my Hand well enough,
and no doubt with Joy, put it into her
Pocket, without being perceiv'd by the Fellow;
and to lose no time, went presently to <i>Berontus</i>; to
whom she said, That she was extreamly concern'd
to see him deceiv'd by two that he rely'd so much
upon, as her young Mistress and <i>Licydon</i>: And
therefore she could not forbear telling him, that
she had discover'd an Intrigue between 'em, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>that they were so familiar, that if they were not
Married already, she was sure they wou'd be very
suddenly; with abundance of Circumstances of
her own Invention, to make the Story more plausible.
He did not believe her at first; but when
she show'd him the Letter, it put him beyond
doubt; so that after he had given her his
Word, whatever Measures he took, not to discover
her, she went away very well pleas'd, that she
had depriv'd me of a Husband, and receiv'd a
good Reward for it. <i>Berontus</i> did not give his
Rage and Grief leave to abate; but in the height
of both, writ a Letter to <i>Licydon</i>, and another to
me. You can't imagine how much I was surprized
when I read it, and found it was a Chalenge,
(for in that Confusion he had mistaken the Direction)
to one whom he accus'd of betraying him
in what was dearer to him than his Life: I cou'd
not guess who it was design'd for, till <i>Licydon</i> came
in, and show'd me a Letter he had just receiv'd,
which he believ'd was for me; and desir'd me to
tell him who that happy Man was <i>Berontus</i> complain'd
so much of. I saw plainly then he was
jealous of <i>Licydon</i>; but was not able to Divine the
Cause: He gave me the Letter which contain'd
these Words;</p>

<p class="in"><i>Wou'd to Heaven you had told me Truth, when you
said you were too young to think of Love; you have
thought of it too much</i> Olinda, <i>for my quiet; but you
were born to Torment me. It is my Fate, why do I
complain of you? Pity me, if I fall by my happy Rivals
Hand, and if you can, forgive me if I survive him.
This is the last time I design to trouble you: I wish he
may be more faithful to you than he has been to me:
Adieu, Madam, pity the unfortunate</i> Berontus.</p>

<p class="in"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span></p><p>The Letter seem'd so full of Distraction, that I
cou'd not chuse but pity him; for I really thought
him Mad: But I did not think fit to shew <i>Licydon</i>
that which was design'd for him. When he was gone
I sent for <i>Berontus</i>, but he refus'd to come, and
'twas with much ado after three or four times sending
he was prevail'd with. I told him by what
means I had seen both his Letters; but that they appear'd
so great Mysteries to me, that I sent for him
to explain 'em. 'Twas long before he wou'd let
me know the Cause of his suspicions; but I was so
importunate, that at last he show'd me the Love
Letter I had writ to <i>Licydon</i>: Can I have a greater
Proof than this, says he? I confess, reply'd I,
you have Reason to think as you do; but you are
much deceiv'd; and then I told him upon what
occasion it was writ: I saw very well he did not
believe me, and I knew not how to convince him,
unless I cou'd find <i>Licydon</i>'s Answer, which at least
wou'd clear him. I found it by good Fortune,
and brought it to <i>Berontus</i>. Read this, said I, and
you'll see whether it be true, that I Writ to <i>Licydon</i>
in earnest: You have nothing to accuse him
of. After he had read it, he cry'd out in a violent
manner, I have wrong'd the innocent <i>Olinda</i>,
and I deserve to be hated by her for ever. Be not
so transported I return'd coldly enough, I may
love <i>Licydon</i>, tho' he be so indifferent: The Postscript
fully clears you, reply'd <i>Berontus</i>, and makes
me not dare to ask you to forgive me: Upon
which I took it, and read these Words, which I
had quite forgot. <i>I did not think one cou'd write so
prettily of Love, and be so insensible of it; How happy
wou'd that Man be, that shou'd receive such a one
dictated by your Heart, as well as Hand.</i> I am sure
none cou'd return such an Answer to <i>Olinda</i>.
This Complement did me so much Kindness, that
one wou'd think I shou'd be a better Friend to 'em
than you know I am. <i>Berontus</i> left me almost as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>angry at himself, as he was before at us; and did
not come near me for some time after. When I
told <i>Licydon</i> what had pass'd between us, he was
amaz'd: He Examin'd his Man, who had been in
the Chamber, who confess'd the Truth; and
our Servant, when she was tax'd with it, hardly
deny'd it; and thus the whole Matter was discover'd;
which had it not been for a happy Mistake,
had probably cost one, or both of them, their
Lives, and me my Honour. Two days after <i>Licydon</i>
was Married, and so our Acquaintance broke
off; for tho' his Wife came to see me and often
press'd me to keep a Correspondence with her; I
never did, for I knew she had been very Jealous
of me before she Marry'd, and I would not hazard
the reviving it. <i>Berontus</i> easily obtain'd his Pardon
of me (for you know I'm very good Natur'd)
and so he continu'd to Visit me, taking all the
pains he could to please me, without any thing
remarkable happening, till three Monthes after,
his Elder Brother, who had been at his Travels,
and was reported to be dead, return'd; so that he
was no longer able to keep the Conditions he had
made with my Mother; for he had nothing to
live upon but his Trade; which I afterwards heard
he neglected very much, and took to that usual
remedy of Cares, Drinking: He said it was to cure
his Grief for the loss of his Mistress, and truly
that is to be lamented, when the loss of a good
Estate is the Cause of it. However he is comforted
for both now, and Married to a Woman with a
great Fortune. I was very glad to be rid of my
Lover, tho' I was sorry 'twas by his misfortune.</p>

<p>Thus <i>Cleander</i>, you have an account of the first
Adventures of my Life; which made me early
know some uneasie Hours: By the next Post I'll
acquaint you with a Catalogue of Lovers (that is,
they were my <i>En passant</i>, in taking their Rounds,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>and serv'd better to divert me than the most
Romantick Constancy, without giving themselves,
or me any trouble) but it's indeed time
to make an end. Adieu my Friend, think of me

<span class="hidden">T</span>O proceed in Order to my Relation, I
must begin with one, who in respect of
his Years as well as the time in which I
knew him, demands the Pre-eminence.
He was a <i>Dutch</i> Coll. about Threescore; Don't
you think one of his Country and Years, will
make a pretty Lover? But Old as he was, he had
a Mistress in the House with him. I was younger
than she, and I believe I may say, without
Vanity, I had some other Advantages over her;
so that the Old Spark had a Month's mind to me;
and I, partly to plague her, and partly to divert
my self, received all his Addresses with a great
deal of complaisance. I cou'd perceive her fret
within her self, tho she durst not shew it. She
was in great fear of losing him; for the Man's
Money had such Charms as aton'd for his want
of 'em, tho' he was Ugliness in perfection; (if
that ben't Nonsense) and 'twas the best Jest in
the World to me, to see him squint an Amorous
Glance upon me with one Eye, whilst 'tother was
watching whether she took Notice of him; for
we Lodg'd in one House together; so that I cou'd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>not avoid often being with them both, nor indeed
did I endeavour it; for I took a malicious pleasure
in laughing at their Follies: Since there's nothing
so ridiculous as an Antiquated Lover, who has
the Vanity to believe he is belov'd, and a Jealous
Woman, who has not Discretion enough to hide
it. That I might be sufficiently entertain'd with
both, one day I began a Discourse of Young and
old Lovers, preferring the last as more Constant,
more Fond, and more Solid than the First: He
Smil'd, and took me by the Hand, and gave me a
thousand Commendations for the Wisdom of my
choice; Nay, and so far forgot himself, that he
apply'd it to himself, and said such passionate
things as wou'd have been extravagant from a
young Fellow. She with a great deal of Heat
contradicted all I had said, and told all the Impertinences
and Inconveniences one finds in an
Old Man (which she experimentally knew better
than I) without considering how far it
touch'd him, she was so earnest against me.
This made him so Angry, and her so out of
Countenance when she reflected so upon what she
had said, that I was never better diverted:
So she did not know what Excuse to make for
her self; and in fine, the Dispute grew so high,
that at last they parted. Upon this the Coll.
was hotter upon me than ever; he pester'd me
continually with his Visits, and the Brute so
little understood my Raillery, that he pretended
an Interest in me, and wou'd check me when
he saw any body younger than himself with
me; but I gave him such Answers, that he did
not know what to make of me. When he had
Orders for <i>Flanders</i>, he told me I must prepare
my self to go with him, and I should
live as great and happy as a Queen; I said I
wou'd go withal my Heart, upon Condition his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>Son should be always with us: The Old Man
started, my Son, Child, what would you do with
him? I think he is fitter company for me than you,
says I, and so I left him, so asham'd, that he shunn'd
seeing me ever after. He e'en went to <i>Flanders</i>
without me, and vow'd, young as he was, he wou'd
never have any thing to do with Woman more.
Thus I was rid of my Old Impertinent, whose
place was soon supply'd by one of those gay youths
who never wait for the slow gifts of pity, but Ravish
little Favours from us, as if they were their
due; who make it impossible for us to think it a
Crime to give what they ask with so much boldness;
and who are always endeavouring to divert
her they design to please. He Courted me with
Balls, Musick, and Entertainments, and in the
midst of 'em wou'd now and then whisper some
pretty Love Maggots. I was first acquainted with
him at a Relations of mine at <i>Greenwich</i>: He was
an Officer in the Army, and was then in the Camp
upon <i>Black-Heath</i>; and being very well known in
the House where I was, he came often there. He
had heard several things of me to my Advantage,
(for Fame generally flatters or detracts) as, that I
sung well, was Handsom, and so forth: And I was
told, that he was very well accomplish'd, and the
Neatest, Prettiest, Gentilest young fellow that was
to be seen in the whole Army: So that we had
both a great desire to see one another, and were
very well acquainted the first time we met: He
told me he had a violent Passion for me, and he
did not doubt but I had a little Love for him; he
came to see me every Day whilst I was there; carried
me to all the Diversions that were to be had
about the Country; and when I was going to <i>London</i>,
he told me he would soon follow me: But as soon
as you come to Town, Faith <i>Olinda</i>, you shall
Write to me, as you hope to see me again; for I
can't live without hearing you Arriv'd safe. So I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>Writ a thousand little mad things, and he Answer'd
me at the same Rate, only a great deal of
Airy Love mingled with it. The following Week
he came to see me, and from that day I was never
suffered to rest for one frolick or other: All the
time he staid, I liv'd a pleasant sort of a Life, till he
went to Fight abroad, and got two or three new
Mistresses to divert, for those sort of Men never remember
the Absent; their Love never enters the
Heart, nor do they often gain ours; they seldom
fail to please indeed, and they force us to think of
'em sometimes whether we will or not; but they
are neither Discreet, nor Constant enough to go any
further: I suppose he forgot me as soon as he left
me, and I was not much behindhand with him. After
he was gone, I had scarce a breathing time before another
of his Profession, more serious, and more designing,
succeeded him: He had a good Estate, and
pass'd in the World for a Man of Honour, and
therefore was Received by my Mother favourably
enough. I neither lik'd, nor dislick'd him; but
treated him with Civility, till I found out that his
designs were not very Honourable; and then I
thought it time to alter my Behaviour: I forbid
him to see me, and when he came to our Lodgings,
I was deny'd to him, tho' he knew I was at home;
upon which he left off coming, and when some of
his Comrades ask'd him the Reason, he told them,
he knew me too well, and that he did not think a
Creature so young cou'd be so Lew'd. Observe,
my Friend, how unhappy Women are, who are
thus expos'd to lose either their Virtue, or their
Honour; if I had comply'd with him, perhaps
none wou'd have been more careful of my Fame
than he: But how much my Choice is to be preferr'd,
none but those who have experienced the unexpressible
satisfaction it gives can know. I heard of
it with a great deal of indifference, and did not so
much as hate the Author of the scandal. The next
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>in waiting was a <i>French Beaux</i>: He had a great
stock of Wit, but more Vanity, a mighty Flatterer,
and one who took much pains to perswade credulous
Women that he lov'd them; and if he succeeded, he
always forsook 'em, and sometimes gratify'd
his Vanity to their Cost, who had been indiscreet
enough to give him occasion. He laid his Baits to
catch me, he Vow'd, and Swore, and Danc'd, and
Sung eternally by turns; but I was too wary to be
caught, tho' he made me a hundred Protestations, I
was the only Woman he ever did, or ever cou'd
Love; follow'd me where ever I went, and in
spight of the greatest Rigour I cou'd use, wou'd
not forbear haunting me. I did not know how to
free my self from the Impertinence of this Fop;
but I thought if I cou'd convince him of one Act
of Inconstancy, he wou'd not have the Confidence
to trouble me any more: I had many contrivances
in Order to it, but at last I fix'd upon one that was
probable enough to take with one of his Humour.
I Writ a Letter (disguising my Hand) as from a
Woman extreamly in Love with him, and desir'd
him to tell me sincerely whither he was engaged or
not; for I was too just to rob any Woman of his
Heart, and too nice to be content with a part of it.
I told him if he was free, I wou'd meet him, the
next day at the Bird-Cage in the Park: He sent a
very obliging answer to the unknown Lady; and said,
he was passionately in Love with her Wit; that if
her Beauty were Answerable, he must be undone;
however 'twould be such a pleasing Ruin, that he
waited with the highest impatience for the appointed
hour, when he might assure her by word of Mouth,
his Heart was wholly at her dispose. Just as I had
done Reading this Letter he came in, and for a
Proof of his Constancy, shew'd me that which I had
sent him, with another, which he said was the Answer
he design'd to send; wherein he told her, he
was already so deeply in Love, 'twas impossible for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>him to change; with abundance of fine things of
the Person he Lov'd. This was good sport for me,
and I had much ado to keep my Countenance; I
us'd all my Rhetorick to perswade him to stay with
me; a thing I had never desir'd of him before, and
now 'twas in vain: He pretended earnest business,
and went long before the Hour, he was so very
impatient. When he was gone, I chang'd my
Clothes, took a Lady with me, who was Privy to
the Affair, and went to the aforesaid Place. We
were in Masks, and it being duskish, he did not
know us; but after I had banter'd him for some
time, I discover'd my self: I cannot describe to
you the different Passions that affected him; sometimes
he was in a Rage with me for putting such
a Deceit upon him, sometimes he wou'd frame
weak Excuses for what he had done, and sometimes
he was not able to speak at all for Grief, that he
was not only disappointed of a new Mistress, but
had lost all hopes of gaining one he had Courted so
long, with so much Assiduity. I went home, as
well pleas'd with losing one, as I have sometimes
been with making a Conquest, in full hopes I shou'd
be plagued with him no more, and I was not deceiv'd.
You see, <i>Cleander</i>, what a Miscellany of
Lovers, if I may call 'em so, I have had, all of different
humours, but none that had found out
the Secret to please me: They have done enough
if they contribute any thing to your diversion, and
made a sufficient Recompence for all their former
Impertinence to</p>

<span class="hidden">T</span>HE Reflections you made upon my two
last are so Just, so Profitable, and so Pleasant,
that thro' them I see the Author's
great Capacity, that can make so good
use of such little things; and while I read, bless
my kind Fate that made you my Friend, when the
Good and Wise are so scarce; and wonder how so
particular a Blessing came to be my Lot; which
more than doubly satisfies for all I suffer'd by
<i>Clarinda</i>'s falseness. I believe you think it strange
I never mention'd her, in any of the Passages of my
Life, since it was before many that I have told
you of, that I knew and lov'd her: But I could
not have Nam'd her without some Marks of kindness,
that I either show'd, or receiv'd from her,
which I would willingly forget, and cou'd not now
speak of her, but when I put your Friendship in
compensation with her Ingratitude. But since I
am fall'n upon this Subject, I will let you know a
little better than you do, the only Woman that I
ever trusted, not with any Secret, for you see I
then had none of consequence; but with my Love,
and in that she betray'd me. Her Sister often told
me, she was sorry to see so sincere a Friendship bestow'd
upon one that knew so little how to Value
it; that <i>Clarinda</i> was the same to all, which she
pretended to be only for me: That she was always
fondest of her new acquaintance, and wou'd Sacrifice,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>or Ridicule the Old, the better to Caress
'em: But I knew there had been some Quarrels betwixt
them, and therefore wou'd not believe it, till
I found it too true; and then my partiality for her,
chang'd into as great an Error on the other hand,
for I involv'd the whole Sex in her Faults, and
with <i>Aristotle</i> (I hope one may condemn ones self
with <i>Aristotle</i>) Repented that I had ever Trusted a
Woman. I don't know whether I forgot I was
one, or whither I had the Vanity to think my self
more perfect than the rest; but I resolv'd none of
the Sex was capable of Friendship; and continu'd
in that Opinion till I knew <i>Ambrisia</i>, who (if one
may judge by the Rule of Contraries, convinces me
of injustice) for she is just <i>Clarinda</i>'s Antipodes.
<i>Clarinda</i> loves new Faces, and professes a particular
kindness at first sight; <i>Ambrisia</i> is a long time before
she goes beyond Civility, and never does but
to those whom she has well observ'd, and found
'em Worthy: <i>Clarinda</i> will Rail at one Friend to
engage another: <i>Ambrisia</i> <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: should be 'can't'">cant</span> hear an innocent
person, tho' her Enemy, accus'd without defending
'em: <i>Clarinda</i> will be one day fond to extravagance,
and the next as indifferent for the same person:
<i>Ambrisia</i> is always the same, and where once she
loves, she never changes: <i>Clarinda</i> is easily angry:
<i>Ambrisia</i> is perhaps too mild. <i>Clarinda</i> has Wit indeed,
but 'tis not temper'd by Judgment, so that it
makes her often do, and say a hundred things that
call her discretion in question: <i>Ambrisia</i> has a Solid
and piercing Judgment, one wou'd <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: should be 'think'">thing</span> all she
says was the Result of premeditation, she speaks
such Wise and such surprizing things, and yet her
Answers are so ready, that one wou'd Swear she
did not think at all; her Actions are always most
regular; I believe she never cou'd accuse her self
of an imprudent one. This is a true and unprejudic'd
Character of both; and if you wonder how I
cou'd love a Woman with such gross Faults, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>must tell you, some of them I did not know then;
some I excus'd, for I did not expect perfection, and
some my partial kindness made me cover with the
Name of some Neighbouring Virtue. You know,
<i>Ambrisia</i> has as great advantages of <i>Clarinda</i> in Body
as in Mind: I have often heard you praise her outward
Beauty, and now I have shew'd you the Beauties
of her Soul, tho' they are far greater than I can
express, give me leave to wish her yours. Forgive me
if I mingle a little self-Interest in my wishes for you,
I can't resist a thought of joy for the hopes of finding
two Noble Friends in one, by such a happy Union:
Think of it <i>Cleander</i>; you only deserve one another. I
know you will bid me take your advice, and shew
you the way; but I shall tell you things that will convince
you, my refusal is reasonable. I was just fifteen
years old when a particular Friend of my Mothers
buried her Husband; whose Grief was so great, that
my Mother durst hardly leave her; she staid with her
Night and Day, and manag'd all her Affairs for
her. She went to <i>Cloridon</i>'s, who had had a Friendship
for the Deceas'd; (for they were forc'd to
make use of that, and his Authority in a business,
wherein the Widdow had lik'd to be wrong'd) but
Men of his Quality are not always at Leisure, and
must be waited on; so that tho' my Mother went
two or three times, she did not see him, and having
other Affairs of her own, and her Friends in hand,
besides being oblig'd to be much with her, she
cou'd not Watch his Hours: However 'twas a
thing of too great consequence to be neglected: So
she Writ a Letter to him, and Order'd me to carry
it, and to deliver it into his own Hand. I went
often to his Lodgings before I cou'd speak with
him, and carry'd <i>Clarinda</i> with me: At last I was
appointed an hour when I shou'd certainly meet
with him, and she happen'd to be so engag'd, she
cou'd not possibly go with me. I knew no body
else I cou'd use so much freedom with, and was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>forc'd to go alone. I did not wait long before I
was admitted, and he approach'd me with that awful
Majesty which is peculiar to him; and that commands
respect from all that see him. Whilst <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: 'he' should be omitted">he</span>
he held the Letter I gave him, I look'd at him
sometimes; but still I met his Eyes, so that I cou'd
not view him well, tho' I saw enough to think him
the Charming'st Man in the World: He ask'd my
Name, and whose Daughter I was? which when I
told him, he said he knew my Father very well;
that he was a Worthy Man, and that for his sake
he wou'd do any thing for me that lay within his
Power. I thank'd him, tho' I took it for a Courtier's
Complement, and desir'd an Answer to the business
I came about. <i>I will go my self instantly</i>, says he, <i>to
see what can be done in it, and give you an Account of
it in the Afternoon; but there's so much Company at my
Lodgings, that 'tis not a convenient place for you: Can't
you come somewhere else?</i> Yes my Lord, <i>says I</i>, very
innocently, where you please: <i>if you will be in a
Hackney Coach then, at Five a Clock by</i> Covent-Garden
<i>Church, I will come to you, and let you know what I can
do for your Friend</i>. I told him I would, and went
away very well satisfy'd with him, for I had no
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: should be 'apprehensions'">apprehensons</span> of any design, from a Man of his
Character. You know all the World thinks him
the fondest Husband upon Earth, and that he never
had a thought of any Woman but his Wife, since
he Marry'd her. This made me secure, and I did
not fail to go at the appointed hour. My Mother
knew nothing of it till afterwards; for I did not see
her that day. When he came to me, he told me,
what he had done; inform'd himself of some things
that were necessary for him to know, that related
to the business, and assur'd me he wou'd do the
Widow Justice. Then he renew'd his Promise to
me with Protestations, that I shou'd command him
as far as his Authority or Interest cou'd go; and
beg'd me to make use of him either for my Relations,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>or my self, when ever I had occasion. After he
had made me some Speeches of my Wit and Beauty,
we parted, and as soon as I saw my Mother, I
told her all that pass'd between us. She was extreamly
pleas'd to have so great a Man her Friend;
especially, one that she had no Reason to suspect of
any ill Design, since he had taken no advantage of
so favourable an opportunity as I had given him to
discover himself, if he had any; nor had not so
much as desir'd to continue the Correspondence.
The next day the business was concluded more to
our satisfaction than was expected. Sometime after
this, a Gentleman of my Mothers acquaintance
told her, he had a mind for a Commission in the
Army, and that he would give a considerable sum
of Money to any Body that would procure it.
My Mother said she'd try her Interest, and made
me Write to <i>Cloridon</i> about it. He sent me an
obliging Answer, and desir'd to see me at the same
Place where we met before, that I might give him
an exact Account of the Person I recommended,
and Answer some Questions about him more particularly
than I cou'd do by Writing. I did so
in the first part of our Conversation; and then he
began to talk of the many ills that Attend greatness,
of which he said Flattery was the chief; for
it was the greatest Unhappiness to be sooth'd in
ones Faults: <i>But</i> Olinda, continu'd he, <i>in you I see
all that Sincerity and Ingenuity that is requisite for a
Friend, and I shou'd think my self very Happy, if you
wou'd let me see you sometimes; if you wou'd tell me of
my Faults, and what the World says of me</i>. You Honour
me <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: should be 'too'">to</span> much my Lord, <i>says I</i>, but you have
taken such care to make all Virtues your own, that
there's no room left for Flattery, or Correction.
To be short, after a great many Compliments of
this Nature he told me, 'twou'd be an Act of so
great goodness, that he was sure I cou'd not deny
him. But what will the World think, <i>says I</i>, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>such private Meetings? <i>If neither you, nor I, tell it,
it won't be known</i>, says he, <i>as it should if I came to Visit:
you. So that I may have the same Innocent Pleasure of
seeing you, which you wou'd not deny me in Publick, without
making any Noise: And since I assure you I have only
a Friendship for you, it can't shock your Virtue</i>. I neither
granted, nor deny'd him his Request; for I did not
know whither I shou'd do the first, and cou'd not
resolve to do the last; both because it might be a
hindrance to our business, and because I was very
well pleas'd with his Conversation. Nothing cou'd
be more agreeable; he is a Man of as much Sense,
and as great Address, as any I ever knew: But
what is more to be commended and wondred at in
a Statesman, he never promis'd any thing that he
did not perform. He gave me his Word for the
Commission I desir'd; appointed me a day when I
shou'd meet him to receive it; and kept it punctually.
These were such great Obligations, that I
cou'd not but have some acknowledgments for 'em.
There was nothing talk'd of in our House, but
<i>Cloridon</i>'s Generosity; and about that time, all the
Town rung of some great Actions he had then
perform'd: So that all things Contributed to encrease
my Esteem of him. I Writ him a Letter of
Thanks, and he told me in his Answer, that he
desir'd no other Recompence for all he cou'd do for
me, but to see me sometimes. I consider'd, that
there was no danger in seeing a Man, that was so
great a Lover of his Lady; and that profess'd only
a Friendship for me: That if ever he shou'd change,
I cou'd easily forbear it, and that whatever happen'd,
my Virtue was a sufficient Guard. So I
consented to it, without letting my Mother know
any thing of it. But I must delay telling you
what these secret Meetings produc'd; for time and
Paper fails me, and will scarce give me leave to
assure you that I am</p>

<span class="hidden">Y</span>OU wou'd pity rather than chide me, <i>Cleander</i>,
if you knew the Cause of my not
Writing to you all this while. I have not
been one moment alone for this Fortnight
past, but condemn'd to entertain a mix'd company,
all of different Humours, different ways of Living, and
of Conversing; so that 'twas almost impossible to please
one without Contradicting anothers Humour. You
may judge how uneasie this was to me; for I've often
told you, I had rather be all my Life alone, than
with a Company that is not chosen: That I sometimes
prefer Solitude even to the best, and that I
had now retir'd to avoid the World: But I find one
never enjoys any thing without disturbance that
one places one's happiness in; and I was to blame
to expect a singular Fate shou'd be cut out for me.
But whatever Accident deprives me of any thing
else I Love, I can never be unfortunate, if <i>Cleander</i>
continues to be my Friend. You may remember I
broke off my last, where I had resolv'd to see <i>Cloridon</i>,
as he desir'd. We met as often as we cou'd,
extreamly to both our satisfactions: He told me all
his little uneasinesses, and had so great a Confidence,
in me, that he discover'd some Intreagues of State
to me, that are yet unknown to some that think
they are not strangers to the most secret transactions
of the Court; and he never undertook any of
his own Affairs of greatest moment, without asking
my Advice. Thus we liv'd for two Months, and
nothing past that gave me Reason to repent an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>Action, that was not ill in it self; but might be so
by the Consequences of it, till one day, when he
had been telling me several things which concern'd
him nearly: <i>But there's one Secret</i>, says he, Olinda,
<i>that I have never told you yet, tho' it takes up all my
Heart: But 'tis that I believe you know it too well
already</i>. I said, I cou'd not so much as guess at it.
<i>What</i>, Olinda <i>interrupted, is it possible you shou'd be Ignorant,
that I am the most in Love of any Man in the
World? How cou'd you imagine, I that knew you so well
cou'd have only a Cold Respect or Friendship for you? No
no</i>, Olinda, <i>I Love you; I love you Ardently; I cannot
live unless you give me leave to tell you so; and to hope
that you will one day return it</i>. I was so amaz'd at this
Discourse, I did not know what to Answer: It
vex'd me to be oblig'd to alter my way of Living
with him; but I did not find my self so Angry at
his Love as I ought. However, I disguis'd my
thoughts, and put on all the Severity that is needful
in such Cases. I have more Reason to be displeas'd
with such a Declaration from you my
Lord, <i>said I</i>, than any other: You that say you
knew me so well; What have you seen in me to Encourage
it? Have I ever given you occasion to
suspect my Virtue? Or is it that you are tired with
my Conversation, and therefore take this most effectual
means to be freed from it? <i>Inhumane Fair!</i>
said he, <i>Must you hate me because I love you? can you
Resolve not to let me see you, only because you know I desir'd
it more than before?</i> In short, he said the most
passionate things that a Lover can imagine; and
tho' I found he mov'd my Heart too much, I dissembled
well enough to hide it from him. Nothing
he said, cou'd prevail with me to see him, and I
hop'd Absence wou'd help me to forget him. He
Writ many melancholly Letters to me, telling me
all the Court took notice of his Grief; that it
would shortly be his death, if I would not see
him; and beg'd me to live with him as I had done,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>and he wou'd never speak to me of his Love. But
still I refus'd, tho' <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: should be 'unwillingly'">unwillinglly</span>. I was Angry at
my self for thinking of him, and for being pleas'd,
when some told in Company where I was, that he
had been so out of Humour for some time, that no
Body durst speak to him of Business. I lov'd to
think it was for me, and ask'd a hundred Questions
about him. But now the Publick Affairs oblig'd
him to go to <i>Flanders</i>, where he perform'd Actions
Worthy of himself. His Valour, Generosity, and
Liberality were talk'd of everywhere, which still more
and more engag'd me. I cou'd not but have some
Inclination for so fine a Man, when I consider'd
that he lov'd me too: However, I believ'd I had
only that Esteem for him which I thought due to
his Merit, and that Gratitude which the Obligations
I had to him requir'd. But I grew insensibly
more Melancholy than Usual. One Evening that
my Mother and I were taking a serious Walk by
the Canal in St. <i>James</i>'s Park, a Gentleman of her
Country, and Acquaintance, seeing us at a distance,
came to bear us Company: The Air being pretty
Cool, we wore our Masks, and after we had made
two or three Turns, he saw a Friend of his, of the
same Nation, coming towards us. <i>That</i>, says he, <i>is</i>
Antonio, <i>Son to my Lord &mdash;&mdash; He is a very well Accomplish'd
Gentleman, and has a good Estate, I wish he
were Married to</i> Olinda. I know the Family, and
have hear'd of him, <i>Replyed my Mother</i>, I shou'd not
dislike the Match. By this time he was come up
to us, and after having beg'd Pardon for intruding,
and leave to Walk with us, he turn'd of my side.
He had not seen my Face, for it was duskish, and
I only made a Fashion of lifting my Mask upon our
first Compliments; but yet he said abundance of
fine things, of my Beauty and Charms. After
half an Hours Conversation we were going home,
and they would needs wait upon us, but one of
his Servants met him, and told him he had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>looking for him a long time; some Friends of his
that were going out of <i>England</i> the next day, staid
for him in the Mall, and must speak with him immediately.
So he left us to the <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: should be 'others'">tothers</span> Care, and
went back. The first time <i>Antonio</i> met with his
Friend, with whom he had seen us; he told him, he
was so Charm'd with the Ladies Conversation,
that he could not rest till he saw her again. He
Answer'd, that he wou'd not like her if he had seen
her, but he wou'd carry him to Visit one, whose
Beauty wou'd soon make him forget her. <i>Antonio</i>
said that Wit and good Humour had far greater
Charms for him, than the finest Face in the World:
But that you mayn't think me obstinate, I will see
her upon condition, that if her Eyes have not that
influence which you expect, you will make me acquainted
with that Lady whose Wit has engag'd
me more perhaps than you imagine. He promis'd
he wou'd, and so left him, and came to our Lodging:
He gave us an Account of this Conversation,
and desir'd us to continue the Humour, and not let
him know we had seen him before; for he fancy'd
a great deal of Pleasure in seeing me Rival my self.
We agreed to it, and when they came, I entertain'd
him with the greatest simplicity imaginable: For
you must know I had an Aversion for him, which
I cou'd give no Reason for (that Passion is as unaccountable
as Love) and therefore I was pleas'd he
shou'd think me a Fool, that he might not desire to
see me again. I was glad to perceive he was uneasie
in my Company, and to make him the more
so, I talk'd very much, and very little to the purpose.
When he was gone, he said to his Friend,
<i>That if</i> Olinda <i>had the other Ladies Soul, she wou'd be
a dangerous Person; but that as she was, he cou'd no more
Love her than a fair Picture: That her Folly had only
made him the more eager to see the unknown, and therefore
he claim'd his Promise</i>. He <i>Answer'd</i>, that he did
not know what a second sight of <i>Olinda</i> might do;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>but however not to be worse than his Word, he
wou'd endeavour to contrive a Meeting, but he
cou'd not promise he shou'd see her Face, for she
was very shy of that, as she had some Reason. I
was extreamly averse to seeing him again, but this
Gentleman was so earnest with me, and my Mother
said so much for it, for she was desirous to have
us acquainted, that I was almost forc'd to go; but
Resolv'd not to shew my Face. He carry'd <i>Antonio</i>
to the Park, at an appointed hour, when he said, he
heard the Lady say she wou'd be there; and we
met 'em as if by chance. We had a Conversation
that wou'd have been diverting enough, if my Hatred
for him had not made me think, all he did
or said disagreeable: He told me I had been continually
in his thoughts since he saw me, and that
I had made such an Impression in his Heart, as
cou'd never be alter'd. I said he must have a
strange Opinion of my Credulity if he thought I
cou'd believe he was in Love with a Woman he
never saw. <i>Ah! Madam</i>, says he <i>how much more
Charming are you Veil'd as you are than a Beautiful
Fool that can only please ones Eyes: Such a one as my
Friend here made me Visit the other day; and then he
gave me a long Description of</i> Olinda, <i>and Related all
her Discourse; which indeed was very insipid</i>. We
made some Satyrical Remarks upon the poor Lady,
and then we parted, tho' <i>Antonio</i> wou'd fain have
gone home with us; but we wou'd not permit him.
He was very importunate with his Friend after
this, to make him acquainted with the unknown;
but he said, he durst not carry him to see her without
her leave; but he wou'd try to gain it, if he continu'd
to desire it, after seeing <i>Olinda</i> two or three times.
He Reply'd, he wou'd endure so much Mortification,
in hopes of so great a Blessing as he promis'd
him, but it must be speedy, for a Lover was impatient;
and he shou'd be better satisfied with seeing
the Ugliest Face he could imagine; than with that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>doubt he was in. In short, he brought him to our
Lodgings several times, and still I acted the Foolish
part; but yet he confess'd to his Friend, that I
had mov'd him a little; and he Refus'd to see me
again for fear he said, that he shou'd Love a Woman
that he cou'd not Esteem: But one moments
interview with his other Charmer wou'd deprive
<i>Olinda</i> of that little part she had gain'd of his Heart.
A little after some young Ladies that I knew, were
going to the Play, and begg'd me to go with them:
I was so chagrin, I cou'd not think of any diversions;
but that made them the more pressing, urging
it wou'd cure my Melancholy. So I went with
them, and the first sight I saw was <i>Antonio</i> and his
Friend. The last seeing a Lady that was not handsome
with me; it came into his thoughts to say,
that was she that <i>Antonio</i> was in Love with. He
gaz'd upon her with the greatest eagerness imaginable,
for a long time; then turning to another that
was with them; which of those two, <i>says he</i>, (pointing
to her and me) do you like best? You amaze me
with that Question, <i>Returned he</i>, for I think there is
too great a Disparity between them, to leave any
doubt that it must be <i>Olinda</i>: (for he <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: should be 'knew'">new</span> my
Name.) You wou'd alter your Opinion, says
<i>Antonio</i>, if you knew them both as well as I; for
<i>Olinda</i>'s Beauty is more than doubly Valu'd by the
others Wit, and solid Judgment. But <i>Olinda</i> has
both, <i>Replyed the Gentleman</i>; which I believe you
can't but know if you have ever talk'd with, or
heard of her: For every body gives her that Character.
They Wrong her extreamly, says <i>Antonio</i>,
for she is really Foolish to deserve Pity; I never
Conversed with a Woman whose Company was so
tiresome; she talks Eternally, and not one Word of
Common Sense. 'Tis impossible your Friend here,
who is a very good Judge, has often said such
things of her to me, that I must think you mistake
the Woman. I have been too often with her for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>that, says <i>Antonio</i>, you may rather believe my
Friend Jear'd her. Then they question'd him about
it; but he Laugh'd, and said, He never saw a
pretty Woman, but he thought she had Wit enough;
so that they did not know what to make of him;
but <i>Antonio</i>, who would not have been sorry to find
as much Wit in <i>Olinda</i>, as he imagin'd in one,
whose outside did not please him so well; took
some pleasure in fancying himself deceiv'd; tho'
when he consider'd it seriously, he could not believe
it. However he enquired diligently of all
that cou'd inform him any thing of me, which did
more confound him: For they agreed, that I was
far from being a Fool, and he cou'd not imagine to
what end I shou'd pretend it: But was Resolv'd
to find it out. He came often to see us, and still
found me the same Fool, till one day when we had
a great deal of Company, I was extreamly put to
it; for I did not care for making my self ridiculous
to so many; and 'twas not good Manners to
be silent; however, I chose rather to be Rude, than
undeceive him: I often made as if I did not hear
when I was spoke to; but I was obliged to Answer,
when one said to me, what's the matter with you
<i>Olinda</i>, that you are Dumb of a sudden? I am sure
you ought not; for if it were pardonable in any
Woman to talk always, 'twould be in you, that do
it so well. I was so confused at this Compliment,
that came so <i>male a propos</i>; that I believe I did not
Answer it over wisely; but as my ill Fate would
have it, a Lady in the Company took a Paper out
of her Pocket, saying, <i>I am resolved to make</i> Olinda
<i>speak whether she will or not; and I will leave you to
judge, whether she does not do it well in this Song</i>. So
she read one that I had Writ at her desire; for she
sung very well. I would fain have denyed it, but
I saw it was in vain, for Wit will out one way or
other. <i>Antonio</i> seemed overjoyed at this Discovery,
and I was as much grieved: For no Woman had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>ever a greater desire to be thought Wise, than I to
be thought otherwise. He came to see me every day
from that time, and when his Friend told him, that
he hoped he would not dispute <i>Olinda</i>'s Power any
longer, since she made him so absolutely forget
her, whom he had once preferred so much to her;
he said, that it was not the same <i>Olinda</i> whom he
loved, for she had chang'd her Soul. Nor had he
forgot the other, for it was that Wit, that same
turn of Thought, and agreeable Conversation which
he admir'd in her, that he ador'd in <i>Olinda</i>. I
do not know, whether he ever knew, that they
were both one Person, but he did not desire to see
the other. When he discovered his Love to me, I
entertained it so coldly, that he could have little
hopes, but that is the last thing that quite forsakes a
Lover: And it did not hinder him from persisting.
He watched his opportunity, when he saw any
thing had pleased me, but still he was Repulsed
with greater Scorn. I took delight when he was
with me, to Repeat often those Words in <i>Sophonisba;
The Fort's impregnable, break up your Siege, there
is one for you too mighty entered in; the Haughtiest,
Bravest, foremost Man on Earth</i>. He importuned me
extreamly to know who this Happy Man was; and
Vowed if I would tell him, he'd never mention
his Passion to me again; but I told him, if there
was such a Man, it was the same Reason he should
trouble me no more, as if he knew who he was;
since that could make no alteration in my heart:
And perhaps it was a Secret; however, that I
would hear no more of his Love. He Begg'd, and
Sigh'd, and Whin'd, an Hour or two to make me
Reverse my Doom; but in vain; and I was pleas'd
that he believed me in Love, tho' I did not think
it my self. He continued to Visit me without
saying any thing of particular to me; and without
suspecting the Object of my Love; 'till my Mother
and some Company were talking of the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>Actions <i>Cloridon</i> had done; just as they Named
him, he looked at me, (by chance it may be) but
I being a little Guilty, thought it was designed,
Blushed, looked down, and was confused, which
made me blush the more; and that was enough to
fix a Jealousie that had long possest him, and that
Watched for the least shadow of Reason to place
it upon any particular person. I was so ashamed
of my self, that I was not able to stay in the Room,
and when I was gone, <i>Antonio</i> kept up the Discourse
of <i>Cloridon</i>; begun to praise his Person, and
ask'd my Mother what she thought of him. She
said, 'twas so long since she had seen him, that she
had almost forgot him; but that her Daughter had
seen him lately, (and so told upon what occasion)
and that she Extolled him for the finest Man she
ever saw. This confirmed his Jealousie; and the
first Opportunity he had with me, he told me some
News of <i>Cloridon</i>: And then asked me if I had
ever seen him, and how I liked him. I knew nothing
of what my Mother had said; and not being
willing he should believe what I found he suspected;
I answered, that I had seen him two or three
times in Walks at a distance: That I thought he
was well enough, but not so handsome as Fame
had made him. There needed no more to remove
all doubt that he was his Rival; but how to know
the particular Terms we were in, was the difficulty;
he knew his Character, and thought me Virtuous,
and therefore could not fear any thing Criminal
betwixt us; but he resolved to try if my
Affections were strongly engaged; and to that end
he shew'd me a Letter from <i>Flanders</i>, wherein it
was told him, that <i>Cloridon</i> (to the great wonder of
all there) had a young Lady disguised in Men's
Cloaths with him all the Campagne, and that it
was discovered by an Accident, which he gave a
large Account of. I found my self seized with an
unusual I know not what, and did all my endeavours
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>to conceal it, but I changed Colour two or
three times, and he having his Eyes continually
upon me 'twas impossible but he must observe my
concern: However, he said nothing of it to me, and
I forced my self to talk of things indifferent. As
soon as I was alone, I examined my self upon the
matter. Why should this trouble me (said I within
my self) who would not entertain his Love,
when it was offered me, and I have often Resolved
never to see him, even when I thought him Constant?
How comes it then, that I am so Grieved
and Angry that he loves another? And that I wish
with such impatience for his Return? In fine, I
discovered, that what I had called Esteem and
Gratitude was Love; and I was as much ashamed
of the Discovery, as if it had been known to all the
World. I fancyed every one that saw me, read it
in my Eyes; And I hated my self, when Jealousie
would give me leave to Reason, for my extravagant
thoughts and wishes: Mean while <i>Antonio</i>
would not be Idle, he thought this was the time
for him; when my Anger was Raised against <i>Cloridon</i>;
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: 'that' should be omitted">that</span> that and my Obedience to my Mother
(if he could get her of his side, which he did not
much doubt) would induce me to Marry him; and
then he did not fear, but Reason and Duty would
overcome my Love. Accordingly he had my
Mother's Consent, and entreated her to intercede
for him; but all this was so far from having that
effect which he expected, that I hated him the
more: I was so unjust as to look upon him as the
Cause of my Affliction, and I was so Angry to see
him take such Measures, as I foresaw must make
me very uneasie, that I treated him ill, even to
Rudeness. But I will leave him and <i>Olinda</i> equally
unhappy, till the next Post; and then give you an
Account of some Alteration in their Affairs, which
if it gave her ease, I believe a little encreased his
pains. In the mean time believe, that I remain</p>

<span class="hidden">'T</span>IS not possible for you to imagine, much
less for me to express what I endur'd, by
my own Jealousie, and <i>Antonio</i>'s Persecution:
Either of 'em wou'd have been
grievous enough, but together they were intolerable;
and I cou'd expect no Remedy, for I knew
not what I wou'd have. I did not continue one
moment in the same Mind; I long'd for <i>Cloridon</i>'s
Return, and yet I resolv'd not to see him, tho'
when I thought that perhaps he would not desire
it, I almost dy'd with the Fear; but that was
soon over, for a Week after <i>Antonio</i> had shew'd me
the Letter I mention'd in my last, he came to
Town, and sent me a Letter the first Night, fill'd
with the tenderest expressions of Love, and Vows,
that all his Fortune and Conquests abroad could
not give him the least Joy, whilst I remained inexorable;
and a hundred Entreaties to see him
once, and he shou'd die contented. This was some
satisfaction to me; but 'twas but imperfect:
Sometimes I believ'd all he said, and presently
after call'd him false and Perjur'd: One while I
resolv'd not to answer him, and the next Minute
chang'd my Mind; but I was long before I cou'd
fix upon what to say. At last I writ with a great
deal of affected coldness, only I gave him some
dark Hints of the Lady I had heard was with
him, which in his Answer he said, he did not
understand. He writ several times to me by private
Direction, which I had given him when I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>believ'd he was only my Friend; but a little after
he sent to our Lodgings, to tell me, that he had
a Place at his disposal, which if I had any Friend
that wou'd accept of it, was at my Service. My
Mother made me return him Thanks, and tell
him, that I had a Relation who was very fit for
the Employment, who shou'd wait upon him, but
he was not now in Town. <i>Cloridon</i>, who desir'd
no better occasion, sent me word, that if I wou'd
let him see me, he wou'd tell me what was to be
done in it; for it was not a thing to be neglected,
because there were a great many pretended to it,
who might get it by some other means, since it
did not wholly depend on him. I did not know
what pretence to make to hinder my going, for I
durst not tell my Mother of our Meeting without
her knowledge: And perhaps I was glad of the
necessity of seeing him, since it took away the
Fault, and serv'd for an excuse both to my self
and him; tho' I was sorry to be forc'd to receive
new Obligations from him. I never saw a Man
in such an extasie of Joy, as he appear'd to be in
at this Interview: He was Speechless and Motionless
for a long time, and when he spoke, 'twas
with so passionate and charming Words and Air,
that I was not able to say those severe things I
design'd. I check'd him for obliging me to see
him, after I had refus'd him so often, that he
might know 'twas contrary to my Inclinations;
but (as he told me since) he saw something in my
Eyes which made him think, I was not very Angry
with him: And when I explain'd that part
of my Letter which hinted of the Lady, I did it
in such a manner, that he believ'd me Jealous.
At first he seem'd amaz'd at what I told him, but
afterwards he deny'd it so coldly, and took so little
pains to perswade me 'twas false, that I was
enrag'd; which still discover'd my Weakness the
more. He found one pretence or other for delaying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>the Business, and for seeing me two or three
times, and took pleasure in heightning my Jealousie;
till he thought, if he trifled with me any longer,
he might lose me for ever: And then he begun
to protest seriously, There was no such thing,
that it must be the invention of some particular
Enemy of his; for if I wou'd give my self the
trouble to enquire, I should find it was no general
Report, and 'twere impossible it shou'd not be
known by every Body, if what I had heard was
true. We easily believe what we wish; and when
I consider'd from whom I had the Story, I much
doubted the truth of it: And whilst I saw him,
and heard him Swear, he had never had the least
inclination for any other Woman since he saw me.
I was firmly perswaded of his Fidelity; but my
suspicions return'd a little, as soon as I left him.
He told me, he cou'd willingly forgive the Invention,
since it had occasion'd the discovery of my
Sentiments, which were to his Advantage; but
reply'd, That he need not much boast of what my
Weakness had reveal'd; for tho' I cou'd not now
deny that my Heart took too great a part in what
concern'd him, yet since he knew it, nothing
shou'd prevail with me to see him again; and so I
left him: But I cou'd not forbear saying at parting,
that he had made me very unhappy, and I
wish'd I had never seen him, tho' I condemn'd my
self a hundred times for it afterwards. I ask'd of
all I knew that had been in <i>Flanders</i>, or had any
Correspondence there, if they heard of <i>Cloridon</i>'s
having a Lady Disguis'd with him; but they assur'd
me, there was not so much as the least Report
of it, which pretty well satisfied me as to that:
For every Action of a Man of his Quality, and in
his Post, is so narrowly observ'd, that a thing so
extraordinary cou'd not have been a Secret; but
yet I was very desirous to know upon what ground
that Letter was writ to <i>Antonio</i>. However I wou'd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>not examine him about it, because I saw he suspected
my Love already, tho' he had never told
me; but still continued my most assidious Humble
Servant and Tormentor: And I think I was not
much in his Debt, for I really treated the poor
Man Barbarously. My Mother gave him all the
opportunities she could, and one day that she had
some business that would keep her out till Night;
she left me at home, and gave Orders that no body
should be admitted to see me but <i>Antonio</i>. I was
so vexed at this Command, that I resolved to revenge
my self upon him, and when I heard the
Noise of one coming up Stairs, I prepared to give
him the rudest Reception I could: I sate Reading
with my back towards the Door, and did not rise
when he came in, till I saw a Man kneeling by my
side; and then without looking towards him, I got
up and walked to the other end of the Room. <i>What,
Madam</i>, says he, <i>is my Offence so great? Or do you hate
me so much, that you will not hear me ask for Pardon?</i>
I found something in the Voice soft, and moving,
which struck me like one I was accustomed to be
pleased with; and turning about, I was amazed,
Good God, <i>cryed I</i>, is it possible? Are you <i>Cloridon</i>;
or do I Dream? How could you come here?&mdash;&mdash;,
<i>How could I forbear coming so long?</i> interuppted he, <i>or
how can I live a moment from you? I must see you</i> Olinda,
<i>whatever I hazard, and since you refused to let me
a securer way, how could I neglect so favourable an opportunity</i>?
Then I desired to know by what means
he knew, that I was alone; and he told me, that since
the last time he saw me, and that I had been so
good as to own my self sensible of his Love, he had
had a hundred Plots and Contrivances to see me;
but found none so feasible as that, which he had put
in Execution. He sent a Servant whom he confided
much in, and Ordered him to try all means possible
to know my Motions when I went out, and
when I was at home alone; and he had found the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>way to gain the favour of a Servant that belonged
to the Landlord of the House, (no doubt he feted
her well,) and she had engaged to be secret, and
to send him word when I was alone; but she did
not know for whom she did this Service; only
he had told her, that it was a Man of Quality
that was in Love with me, and desired to see me
privately, to know how I was affected towards
him, before he declared himself publickly. He
came to her that morning, and she told him, my
Mother was gone out, and that she heard her say,
she should not come Home 'till Night; so that if
he would come with the Person that was to see
me, she would be at the Door to conduct him
to me: When they came, she told them, that a
Gentleman that courted me had been there just
now, but she denied that I was at home on purpose
to oblige him. I was angry that he should
take so little care of my Reputation; but he
said, that it was not at all in danger, for no body
knew of it but that Servant who would not tell it
for her own sake; or if she did, she saw that 'twas
all without my Knowledge. That if I would not
give my Consent to see him abroad, he should do
something more extravagant that might expose
both me and him: But if I would, he'd promise
never to speak of his Love to me. In sine, by
Threatnings and Intreaties, and my own Inclination,
I was prevailed with, after I had made him
swear not to mention his pretended Passion. Forgive
my Frailty, dear <i>Cleander</i>, it was not possible
for me to refuse the Man I loved any thing that
could admit of excuse, and I found or made Arguments
enough to sooth my Inclination, and persuade
me it was no Fault only to see him. I
hastned him away for fear he should be seen with
me, but he lingred on for two or three hours
and just as he was going I heard <i>Antonio</i>'s Voice
asking for me, so that he could not go out without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>meeting him. I was extreamly vexed, but this
was no time to fret or chide. I desired him to
step into a Closet, which I had in the Room; where
I kept my Books, and told him I would contrive
a way to be rid of the other quickly. When I had
Locked him in, I took my Hoods and seemed to
be putting them on, in order to go abroad, so
that <i>Antonio</i> could not in good Manners stay; but
he desired, since he was so unhappy as to be deprived
of that satisfaction he expected in my
Company, that I would lend him some Book to
divert his Melancholy. I told him, that he would
have found so little in my Company, that he needed
not much mourn for the loss of it: But as my
ill Fate would have it, he was so pressing to borrow
a Book, that I knew not how to refuse it;
I turned the Discourse and sat down, and said, I
had altered my Resolution, and would stay at
home. <i>Antonio</i> wondred at this mighty Favour,
he was so unused to receive any from me, that he
was Transported at it: He thanked me for it a
hundred times, and I believe presaged no little
good Fortune for him from such a Change, tho'
my way of entertaining him, gave him no great
encouragement. If I should give you a particular
Account of our Conversation, it would be as impertinent
to you, as it was troublesome to me; I
will only tell you, I never passed an Hour with
half so much pain as that, having for addition to
the usual uneasiness his Company made me endure,
that of the unseasonableness of the time. Whilst I
was fretting at this unhappy Accident, and fearing
he would not go away till my Mother came home,
our Landlord's Maid came to tell me, there was one
below would speak with me: I went down and
saw it was that Servant of <i>Cloridon</i>'s, which he had
spoke of to me; he told me, that the King had
sent twice for his Lord, and desired me to tell him,
that he must of necessity go presently, for the business
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>was of importance. This was a new Vexation;
and I staid some time to deliberate what I
should do, and at last, resolved to say I was sent
for by a Lady that was Sick, that so <i>Antonio</i> might
be obliged to leave me. But how was I surprized,
when I returned and found <i>Cloridon</i> in the Room!
I needed not dissemble an astonishment, for I was
as much amazed to see him there, as if I had not
known he was in the House. He advanced towards
me, with a Ceremonious Bow, saying, <i>You
have Reason, Madam, to wonder, and to be Angry at me?
but when you know, that it is the general Frailty of
Mankind that brought me hither, your goodness sure will
pardon me: I mean Love, Madam, Love which makes
the Wisest Men guilty of the greatest Irregularities</i>. I
blushed at what he said, not apprehending his
design, and told him his being there, and his Discourse
were both so mysterious to me, that I did
not know what to answer him. He said, he
thought himself obliged to tell the Truth, since
my Reputation would be in danger by concealing
it: But first he must beg me to pardon the Servant
of the House, and not to let her Master know of
it; for he having taken a fancy to her, had wheedled
her into a Consent, to let him come and see her,
tho' the Wench was very honest: That our Family
being all abroad, she had brought him into that
Room, and hearing me returned, she had put him
into the Closet, believing I would go out again:
But finding I staid long, he had entertained himself
with my Books, and in removing some had
thrown down others, the noise of which had made
<i>Antonio</i> open the Door; and since it was his Fortune
to be discovered in a Foolish thing, he hop'd
the Gentleman and I, would let it go no further.
We gave him our Word for it; and when he was
gone, we both sat silent for a long time, each expecting
what t'other would say: At last he begun.
<i>Cloridon</i> was hard put to it, to be forced to discover
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>such a secret; he that has acquired the Reputation
of Chast, found out to be so little Nice, as to take
such pains, for one of so mean Quality, and one
that has not many things to recommend her. You
have the Luck, <i>said I</i>, to find out <i>Cloridon</i>'s Intreagues,
when no body else knows any thing of
'em: And he may thank his Good Stars his secret
falls into such hands; if you are as careful of this,
as you have been of that in <i>Flanders</i>, which no
body but you has ever heard of. <i>I shall certainly
conceal it Madam</i>, replyed he, <i>for your Fame sake; for
the malicious World would be apt to fancy his thoughts
were something higher than a Dirty Wench, when he
was put into your Closet: But I am to believe what you
please, and if you tell me you never saw him before, but
in Walks at a distance, I won't doubt of it</i>. I am not
much concerned what you, or any thinks of me,
<i>says I</i>, my satisfaction does not depend upon Opinion:
And I shall be always happy, as long as I
am innocent; whether you believe me so or not.
However I owe so much to Truth, to assure you,
that whatever designs <i>Cloridon</i> had, I knew no more
of his coming here than you did, and that I am
very Angry at him for it. <i>If you had not told me so
Madam, I should, it may be, have thought you would rather
have lent me a Book, than endured my Company so long
(which you always used to avoid) but that you feared I
should see him, if you opened the Closet; but I am very
glad, you will have me interpret your staying with me
more to my advantage.</i> I was vexed he should think
it was to oblige him; and since I found he was
Master against my Will, of the greatest part of my
Secret, I thought it best to make him a Confident
of it, which would prevent his Addresses to me,
and engage him to the greater Fidelity. I told
him then, all that was betwixt us; and he gave
me some good Counsels, not to cherish a Love, or
entertain a Correspondence that might in the end
prove dangerous, considering his Circumstances;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>but I was too far gone to take them, and besides,
coming from a Rival, I did not make much Reflexion
upon them. Advices by an interested
Person, tho' never so reasonable, are not minded,
or at least are much suspected, especially when
they contradict the inclination of the Advised. I
did not tell him, I had consented to see <i>Cloridon</i>,
because I resolved not to tell him any thing, but
what I could not conceal. I did not see <i>Antonio</i>
in a Month after, but he sent often to ask how
we did, and said, <i>he was very ill himself</i>. He Writ
once to me, to tell me he was endeavouring to
overcome a Passion, which he found was displeasing
to me, and which therefore must make him
very unhappy; and to beg me, if he could effect it,
to accept him as a Friend, and not continue that
hatred for him then, which I had for my Lover.
Mean while, the too Charming <i>Cloridon</i> and I met
together often: At first we entertained one another
with all the News, and little Intreagues of the
Town; he put so entire a Confidence in me, was
so pleased to see me, and so obliging to me, and
my Relations upon all Occasions, that I then
thought my self happy, to a degree that left no
Room for Wish; for he gave me the greatest evidences
of his Love, without speaking of it to me,
which was all I could desire from a Man, whose
Love I preferred to every thing but Virtue; and
who I could not hear talk of it without a Crime:
But how easily are we drawn in by such steps as
these, to things we had made the strongest Resolutions
against. In some time he made Complaints
to me, and spoke of his Passion in a third Person, so
that I might understand him, but I could not be
angry with him; and I knew not how insensibly,
and by degrees I accustomed my self to hear of his
Love; at first defending my self against it, and
chiding him for breaking his Word; but his Excuses
seemed to me stronger Reason than my Accusations;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>and at last I suffered it with Pleasure,
and without Reluctancy. Thus my unwary Heart
entangled it self more and more, pleasing it self
with its own Folly, without looking backward or
forward; happy for the present on all sides, for
now I was no longer troubled with <i>Antonio</i>. He
after a Months absence came to see me, and told
me, he desired nothing of me now but my Friendship,
and to convince me, he was not my Lover,
he would tell me a secret in favour of <i>Cloridon</i>, if
I would promise to forgive him; I told him I
would, and then he gave me that Account which
I have given you, of his first suspecting my Love,
and how to try it, he had feigned that Letter
which he shewed me; that he had resolved to undeceive
me, as soon as he had discovered what
Sentiments I had for him; but when he saw how
it affected me, Jealousie would not give him leave,
and love prompted him to make use of it to his
own Advantage. He added, that tho' Love had made
him guilty of Treachery so much contrary to his Nature,
yet I should always find him the most sincere,
and the most faithful of his Friends. Tho' I believed
before that Story to be an invention; you cannot imagine
how much I was pleased, to be sure of it now.
I easily pardon'd him, since I had promised it, and
since I thought he deserved it, having told it voluntary.
From that time I received him more
favourably than I used to do, and took some pleasure
in his Conversation, because he was the only
Man that knew of my Love, and that I could talk
with freely of <i>Cloridon</i>. But now my Mother perceived
I had some more complaisance than before
for <i>Antonio</i>; she wondred he talked nothing of
Marriage to her, and told me her thoughts, which
put me upon new contrivances, how I might shun
her Anger, and yet <i>Antonio</i> come off with Honour.
I found him raise scruples against all the Methods
I would invent, and often he asked me, if I design'd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>never to Marry, and what Reasons I could always
give for not doing it; which made me apprehend
he was not altred so much as he seemed; and fear I
should have some trouble in this Affair, he had
told me, that when he was very young, his Father
had contracted him to a kinswoman of his,
that lived in the House with them, who had a
great Fortune, and he heard was handsome, and
witty; but he went to his Travels before it could
be known, whether she was either so; that he had
never had any Love for her: I had a great mind
to let my Mother know this, for I knew she was
scrupulous in such things, and would not consent
to Marry me to a Man, that had any engagement
to another; but I was loath to do it, without his
leave, since he was so sincere as to tell it me, and
because I was afraid to exasperate him. I took a
great deal of Pains to flatter him into a complyance;
I told him my Mother could not have the
worse Opinion of him for it, since it was a thing
done when he was so young, and that he could
have no other Reason to hinder him, now that he
had no design upon me, which if he had, I should
find other ways to disappoint them, tho' perhaps
they might make me more uneasie. At last, with
much difficulty he agreed to it, and when I told it
to my Mother, I found her affected as I wish'd;
which when <i>Antonio</i> knew, he fetched a great Sigh,
and only said, <i>Have I lost all my hope then, Madam?</i>
and so went away extreamly discomposed. A
while after he came to take leave of us, and said
his Father had sent for him in haste, to go to his
own Country; but he told me in private, that he
could stay no longer in a place, where he grew
every day more and more unhappy; and that now
he had resolved to leave it: He could not forbear
telling me, that he had only concealed his Love all
this while, to get into my Favour, and in hopes
of finding something which might give him hopes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>But since I had now deprived him of all, he would
not encrease his Misery, by seeing every day the
Objects of his Love, and of his Hate, his cruel
Mistress, and his happy Rival. I am told his Father
presses him extreamly to Marry, being his only
Son, but he waves it. I should think I had given
you a Description of a Miracle of Constancy in
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: should be 'spite'">spight</span> of Rigours and Absence; but that in this
Age, kindness is a more effectual way to cure
Love; an unlucky thing, since no body will attempt
it, that has that design; but I, (or Fortune
for me,) found you see, a less dangerous way to
free my self, with more ease than I could hope,
and I think it is time to deliver you now, and
give you a little respite till next Post, when you
may expect the continuance of the History of</p>

<span class="hidden">I</span>F I did not know to the contrary by my
own Experience; you wou'd make me believe,
that Friendship and Love can't be
contain'd in one Breast. Is it possible you
can be so much taken up with <i>Ambrisia</i>, that you
have not time enough to tell me of it; and that in
this Solitude, I should hear of <i>Cleander's</i> Affairs
from two or three, before I knew any thing of
'em from himself: They tell me you are every
day with your New Mistress, and that you are
well receiv'd there. I should be pleas'd with it,
if I did not fear, instead of finding two Friends,
to lose that one, whose Friendship I prefer to all
other things: But you'll make me almost Jealous
of her if you don't write quickly, for this is my
fourth since I've heard from you. Tell me <i>Cleander</i>,
you that search into the Nature of things,
that know the Passions of Men; how they are
form'd in the Soul, and by what means, and what
Degrees they rise; tell me how I may give that
Awe, that fear, or that Respect which I hear often
talk'd of, that makes Men not dare to tell a
Woman that they love her. Is it the Grave, the
Sour, the Proud, or modest Looks? Or is there
no such thing, but in Songs and Romances? For
my part, I could never meet with it; and tho'
perhaps there is some Pleasure in being belov'd, I
cannot endure to be told of it, unless by the Language
of the Eyes, or so; for that we need not
understand: But there's nothing so dull, or so
troublesome to me, as a declar'd Lover: This Reflection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>was occasion'd by an Adventure happen'd
to me two days ago; a Stripling of Eighteen,
whose Father and Mother had been Servants in
the Family where I am, said to one in the House
(who told me) that he was in Love with me, and
after had the Insolence to tell me himself, that he
was in Love; <i>But you little think with whom, Madam</i>,
added he; and just as he was going to finish
his Declaration, by good Fortune he was call'd
away: Can any thing be more provoking? Teach
me where to place my Anger, on the Men, or
on my self. <i>Antonio</i> was bashful to a Fault in
other things, and yet he did not fear to say all he
thought, and it may be more to me. <i>Cloridon</i>,
who treated me with the highest Respect imaginable,
discover'd his Love to me, as soon as he
knew it himself; and many have pretended it,
that never felt any, at least for me. The last indeed
had encouragement enough, not to repent
of what he had done, and Reason not to despair
of any thing he could ask; so that after being
two Years contented with my Love, he resolv'd
to put it to the Trial, and begun to pretend to
Favours, with all the Arguments he could invent,
or find, to perswade me of the innocence and lawfulness
of what he ask'd: You may find what influence
they had upon me by the following Lines,
which he sent me in a Letter next day.</p>

<p class="in">I believe I spoke from my Heart, when I told him
I hated him; I'm sure I thought so then, when I
saw him whom I believ'd to have an Esteem
and Respect for me, act as if he had neither. I
said the most violent things I could imagine against
him, and left him without the least Reluctancy:
But my Rage, or Hate, was soon converted
to a Quiet Stupid Grief, that overwhelm'd
my Soul, and left me not the Power of easing it
the common way, in Tears or Complaints. I saw
that I must resolve never to see him again, whatever
it made me endure: And in fine, I saw all
that could make me unhappy, without any hopes
of a Remedy; for tho' he writ to me often to beg
my Pardon, and Vow'd a thousand times he wou'd
not be guilty of the same fault again, tho' he
were sure to be successful; yet I prevail'd with
my self absolutely to refuse to see him, with more
Resolution than I thought my self capable of;
for I consider'd it was dangerous to trust him,
notwithstanding his Protestations, since he had
broke his Word before: And I don't know if I
had not some Reason to distrust my self, after having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>gone so far, as not only to suffer him to talk to
me of his Love, but to own mine to him. When
he saw this would not do, he had recourse to his
old way of Writing upon Business; but the Letter
came first to my Hands, and so I stifled it, and
said nothing of it to my Mother. A Week after
a Porter came to me, and said he was sent by the
Countess of &mdash;&mdash; who desir'd me to go immediately
to her Lodgings, for she had something of
great Consequence to tell me, and that he left her
at a place where she had Din'd, but she was just
going home. Away I went, and when they told
me she was not at home, I thought she would not
fail of being there presently, and went up Stairs
to Stay for her: When I came into the Room, I
saw <i>Cloridon</i> there, and wou'd have retir'd; but he
civilly hinder'd me, and told me, he was waiting
for his Cousin (for this Lady was nearly related to
him) whom he expected to come in very soon;
but 'twas a great happiness I came before, and
more than he cou'd have hop'd for from Fortune;
for at first he pretended it was Chance brought us
together there; but he knew I must find it out,
and so to prevent my discovering it to the Lady,
he told me, that coming to Visit her, and not finding
her at Home; it came into his thoughts to
send for me in her Name; for he knew that she
us'd to visit me, and often desir'd me to go abroad
with her, or to bear her Company at home; so
that he hop'd he might succeed without being suspected.
I was in great confusion, and very angry
at the Trick he had put upon me; and yet
I could not but be a little pleas'd at it too. I
lov'd to see him, and was glad of an opportunity
to give him his Pardon, which I did, but made a
Vow never to consent to meet him in private, tho'
he begg'd it upon his Knees above an Hour, and
said he would not rise till I had granted it: I suppose
he was not so good as his Word; but I left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>him in that posture, and before I went away, and
charg'd him not to write to me any more. This
Interview serv'd but to increase my melancholy;
I indulg'd it a long time, and thought upon nothing
but what sooth'd and added to it: But at
length considering the occasion of my misfortune,
it represented itself to me, not only as my Folly,
but my Crime; and then I concluded it must be a
Crime to grieve for the loss of that, which 'twas
a Crime to Love; and so fix'd a resolution of overcoming
my Passion, which I endeavour'd to do
by Reason, and by Diversions. Had I had you
my Friend to assist me with your Counsels, I had
found it much less difficult; but now I had the
strongest part of my self to Combat without any
Aid: I often gave Ground, and sometimes suffer'd
my self to be vanquish'd by the bewitching Reflections
of what unequall'd Satisfactions I had
found in his Company, and how many happy hours
I enjoy'd with him; but some good Thought
would rouse my Soul to strive again, and then the
Victory was mine. I find by Experience 'tis but
bravely, heartily, and thoroughly Resolving upon
a thing, and 'tis half done: There's no Passion,
no Temptation so strong, but Resolution can overcome:
All is to be able to Resolve; there's the
Point, for one must lose a little of the first Ardour
before one can do that; and many of our Sex have
ruin'd themselves, for want of time to think.
'Tis not a constant settled purpose of Virtue will
do; there must be particular Resolutions for a
particular Attack; 'Tis easie enough to say, no
Man shall prevail with me to do an ill thing;
the difficulty is, such a Man shall not; he
that I love, he that 'tis Death for me to deny
any thing to: There I got the better of my self,
and as last attain'd to a calm serenity of Mind,
which I have enjoy'd ever since, as much as can
be expected in such a World as this; and which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>nothing can disturb, if you continue to have that
Friendship for me which you have profess'd, and
which your Silence makes me almost doubt of;
but there's hardly any thing I could not more easily
believe, than that <i>Cleander</i> is False or Inconstant.

<span class="hidden">A</span><i>Mbrisia's</i> Cruel, Coy, Disdainful, and you
believe she hates you; and yet <i>Ambrisia</i>
took occasion at Play to impose upon
you as a Penance, not to write for a
Month to one she believ'd you lov'd. If this had
been another's Case, you wou'd have discover'd that
<i>Ambrisia's</i> Jealous. Trust me, she loves you, and
only puts on the usual Disguises of Women as sincere
as she is; and give me leave to justifie her,
and the rest of our Sex in that Case: You have
learn'd so well to feign Love, when you have none,
that 'tis very hard to discern Art from Nature;
and 'tis but reasonable we should be allow'd the
less Guilty part of concealing ours, till we can
know whether you are sincere: Besides, we know
those things are most valu'd, that are obtain'd
with most difficulty; and your natural Inconstancy
gives us Reason to use all means to make you
prize us as much as we can. Your selves too, encourage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>us in it, for you despise a Woman that's
easily gain'd, tho' you rail at the Dissembler; and
we can't begin to love just when you would have
us; so that both for our own sake and yours, 'tis
sometimes necessary to deceive you: And I believe
I may add, that there is a Natural Modesty
in some Women, that makes 'em asham'd to own
their Love. Mr. <i>Dryden</i> in his <i>State of Innocence</i>,
gives our Mother <i>Eve</i> a little of that; tho' some
are of Opinion, it had its Birth from your faithlessness;
and that if you had not been false, we
had never been shie. If it be so, don't you think
we have Reason to be cautious in a thing of such
Weight; But I need not take such pains to defend
this Cause, for mine was a Fault on the other hand,
a too easie discovery of my Love: And to speak
the Truth, whatever we are accus'd of, I believe
that's the more general one. 'Tis only those that
are as Wise as your Mistress, that can have so
much Command over themselves, as to be guilty
of the 'tother; tho' if she knew you as well as I
do, she wou'd find that she has no need to make
use of any Arts to try you, or to preserve you:
However don't despair, the Mask will soon fall off.
You have Reason to wonder at my breaking off
with <i>Orontes</i>, since by what I have told you, <i>Cloridon</i>
cou'd be no occasion of it: But suspend your
amazement a little, tho' my Misfortunes ended at
Seventeen, my Adventures did not, and several
things have happenn'd to me in the Year I have
pass'd since, which you are yet a Stranger to.
You neither know how my Acquaintance begun
with <i>Orontes</i>, nor why it ended. In the beginning
of last Summer, when I was endeavouring to divert
my Love and Grief, I went with a Lady to
see a Play: She was not in humour to Dress, and
would needs have me go <i>Incognito</i>; and as we
were coming out of the Play-House, we were
seiz'd upon by two Sparks, who swore they would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>not part with us; but that either we should Sup
with them, or they wou'd go with us. We did
not know how to be rid of these Impertinents, but
we saw, if we took Coach, we could not hinder
them from going into it; so we resolv'd to walk
to our Mantua-maker, who liv'd hard by; and
when we went in they left us, as we thought:
but a quarter of an hour after, they came up Stairs,
and tho' we were very angry at the Rudeness, yet
they staid a pretty while; and he that had at first
apply'd himself to the other Lady, was very pressing
to be acquainted with her; but my Spark sat
down just opposite to me without saying a Word,
only sometimes desir'd his Friend to go away;
which after he had plagu'd us half an Hour, they
did: The next Week I went to <i>Tunbridge</i> with my
Mother; and the first sight I saw at the Wells, was
this Gentleman: He came towards us very respectfully,
and said he was very glad of this opportunity
of begging my Pardon, for the Insolence
he had been guilty of; he hop'd the Lady who
was with us, whom he had the Honour to know,
would intercede for him. She that was in the
Country with us, and who you know is an intimate
Friend of ours, happen'd to be very well acquainted
with him; and when we came home, she
told me that his Name was <i>Orontes</i>; that he was
a Gentleman who had but a small Fortune; but
to repair it, he was Marry'd to a rich Widow above
Threescore and ten; that tho' she was very
ill Natur'd, he was the best Husband in the
World to her, but he would take his pleasure abroad
sometimes, and she was extreamly Jealous.
He came to visit this Lady, and entreated her to
carry him to see me; for he said he was sensible
of the Affront he had given me the first time he
saw me, and that he was very desirous of some
Occasion to serve me; and he thought himself
obliged to tell me so, and to seek all Opportunities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>of doing it. She consented to it; and he
came often to see us, and was very obliging to
us. I will let you know my thoughts of him, because
you can tell me if they are just; for he said
he was not the same Man with me as with any
Body else: He seem'd to me to have Wit enough,
but 'twas rough and unpolish'd; nothing of that
Politeness which renders a Man agreeable in Conversation.
After the common Theams of the Weather,
and News were discuss'd, playing at Cards,
or taking the Air, were certainly propos'd: But I
have heard, that in other places he was very entertaining,
and had a hundred pleasant Stories to
divert the Company. What can be the reason of
this? I am sure he stood in no awe of me, as his
future Actions shew'd; and he always told me his
Thoughts freely, but plain and blunt, without
giving 'em the turn of Gallantry, which is necessary
to take; and yet he could not want Breeding,
for he always convers'd with People of the
First Quality. The Manner is often more look'd
upon than the Thing; and tho' I'm as little pleased
with Forms as any Woman, yet in some things
'tis the essential part; there are few Men, whose
Esteem or Respect I covet; but I would have all
Men keep that distance with me, as if I gave 'em
Awe; but I could never obtain it of 'em; tho'
none ever gave me so much occasion to lament it
as <i>Orontes</i>. Once, when he was at our Lodging,
my Mother was talking of a Journey she design'd
the next day about Ten Miles off, where she was
to stay all Night: He asked me if I went with
her: I said <i>No</i>; and desired my Mother to return
as soon as she could; because I should be alone
till then. It seems (as he told me since) he had
made an Appointment with a particular Friend of
his about Business of Importance; but having
been long desired to see me alone, he would not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>neglect this Occasion, and sent him an Epistolary
Excuse in these Words:</p>

<p class="in"><i>My Wife thinks I am with you, but</i> Olinda <i>told
me she shall be alone to day, and I don't know when I
shall meet with so favourable an Opportunity; so that
you must excuse me; but I'll certainly see you to
morrow</i>.</p>

<p class="in">His Wife, being always suspicious of Letters
she did not read, went to the Post-House after
this: They made no scruple to give it her; because
they knew 'twas one of their Servants had
brought it; and when she had read it, she went
home in all haste, and had her Husband dog'd to
my Lodgings. When he came there he told me,
that the first time he saw me, he lik'd my Shape
and Mien, and was extreamly taken with my Face,
that he durst not so much as ask me Pardon
whilst he saw me so angry; and that since he was
acquainted with me, my Humour had charm'd
him so, that he could be content to leave all the
World for me: And then, Laughing, ask'd me,
If I could live with him, and he would keep me
a Coach, and let me want nothing I could desire.
I rally'd with him till he begun to talk more seriously,
and then I check'd him for his Insolence;
but it had no effect upon him; And when he saw
that neither Promises nor Intreaties could move
me, and that Opportunity favour'd him, he resolved
to try what Violence would do; he had
sent our Servant a Mile off for to fetch some Fruit,
which, he said, was the best about the Country;
and we were in a back Room near no Body in the
House, so that I was in great Fear; however I
made all the noise and Resistance I could, and was
happily delivered by his old Lady's coming in: She
might easily perceive we were both in Confusion,
tho' she hardly guess'd the true Cause; and I was so
good natur'd as not to tell it her. When she rail'd,
we bore it with a great deal of Patience, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>indeed I wonder'd at his Moderation: I really
thought he would have let her beat me to revenge
his Cause; but he was not so much a Brute,
he hinder'd her, and very civilly led her away.
The next day I saw him at the Wells, and whilst
my Company was Raffling, he took the opportunity
to talk with me, though I avoided him with
all the Diligence I could. <i>Don't frown upon me,
Olinda</i>, says he, <i>you ought to forgive me; Repentance
is all that Heaven requires, and I never in my Life did
an Action that troubled me so much; but if you have
not good Nature enough to pardon me upon that, I must
say something to excuse my self: If I believ'd you Virtuous
before, it must be by an implicit Faith; but the
way to be sure was to try it; and now I shall always
admire that Virtue I could not subdue: Why then should
you be angry with me any longer than my Fault remains?</i>
Though I had a little Prejudice against him, I
thought he spoke with more Eloquence, and a
better Grace, than ever I heard him before; it
may be his Concern inspir'd him; but 'twas to
little purpose, for I was inexorable. I told him,
<i>I did not think him worth my Anger, and should easily
forgive him, upon Condition he would never see me any
more: No</i>, Madam, said he, <i>I'd rather see you angry,
than not see you at all</i>: But in spight of me, he visited
us often; but I always entertain'd him with
a coldness that did not much please him, though
no Body else perceiv'd it. We came to Town in
the beginning of <i>September</i>, and he was once at our
House, and found me alone: He began to talk of a
violent Passion he had for me; but I stop'd him,
and said, <i>That was not a Discourse fit for me to hear
from him</i>. I commanded him to leave me; and
told him if he ever came there again, I wou'd be
deny'd to him. He obey'd me, and I did not see
him again till <i>November</i>. He came in Mourning,
and told us he had had the misfortune to bury his
Wife. He Writ to my Mother to desire her leave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>to make his Addresses to me; which she gave him,
and then he appear'd a declar'd Lover. I was so
us'd to receive him with Anger and Disdain, that
though I had not the same Reason now, I did
not change my Behaviour to him; and for four
Months my Mother let me take my own way,
without speaking one word of <i>Orontes</i> to me: Either
she design'd to observe what I wou'd do of
my self, or she did not think it fit to talk of my
Marrying him so soon after his Wife's Death;
but when she saw I slighted him so long, she said
to me one day, What do you mean Child, to receive
with equal indifference all the Proposals
that are made to you? Do you resolve to lead a
single Life? I should approve of the choice in
one of a better Fortune; but you must conform
your self to yours, and consider that I am not
able to maintain you. If you don't hate <i>Orontes</i>, I
will have you Marry him, he has given so great
proof of his being a good Husband, that you can't
fear he will be otherwise to you; he is Handsome
enough, and very Rich; I believe he loves you,
and in fine, I think you may be as happy with
him as with any Man; therefore, don't be obstinately
bent against your own good. He came in
at the same time, and seconded this command of
my Mothers with Intreaties and Complaints. I
had no Aversion for him, and since my Circumstances
wou'd oblige me to Marry, and that I
knew I could never love any Man; I thought it
might as well be he as any other; so in sometime
after I yielded, and the Wedding-day was appointed
to be the Sixteenth of <i>May</i> last. How do
you think 'tis possible to avoid it now; but many
things happen betwixt the Cup and the Lip. You
are to know that <i>Orontes</i>'s Estate lay near a fine
Seat of <i>Cloridon</i>'s, which he often retir'd to; so
that they were acquainted, and much together;
and that <i>Orontes</i> went to his Country House to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>make some Preparations a Week before the designed
Marriage. <i>Cloridon</i> told him he was extreamly
pleas'd to see him there; for they had made a
match for Hunting five or six days after with
some Friends of his, that were wishing for him.
I must beg your Pardon my Lord, <i>says he</i>, that I
cannot stay so long; for I have business that will
call me to <i>London</i> sooner. If it be not of great
importance, <i>return'd he</i>, pray let me prevail with
you to stay. 'Tis not to be deferr'd my Lord, I
am to be Marry'd. Marry'd, cry'd my Lord, prithee
what Madness possesses thee, so lately freed,
to bind thy self again without any necessity for it?
What Bait next, not another old Rich crabbed
Widow, I hope? I have made a better Choice
now, <i>answer'd Orontes</i>: She has Youth and Goodness
I'm sure; and I have Money enough for us
both. You are in the Right, <i>Reply'd Cloridon</i>; but
may I know her Name. You knew her Father my
Lord, <i>says he</i>, and then Sir <i>Martin Marrall</i> told him
whose Daughter I was. And are you engag'd to her,
<i>Cloridon</i> ask'd? She has promis'd to marry me the
16th of this Month, <i>said Orontes</i>, and therefore my
Lord, I hope you wont take it ill if I leave you
upon so weighty an Affair. <i>Cloridon</i> was not in
humour of making many Compliments; but he
ask'd abundance of Questions, of the beginning
and progress of his Love, and how I had us'd him
all the time; but he could not much boast of my
Favour, which pleas'd <i>Cloridon</i>, and encourag'd
him to endeavour to break off the Match. He told
<i>Orontes</i> he should be oblig'd to go to <i>London</i> that
day, but he would come back again before he went
away; so he left him, and immediately took his
Journey; and as soon as he arriv'd, came to our
Lodgings, where he found my Mother and I together.
Judge of my surprize at this Sight, my
first Thoughts were of <i>Orontes</i>; I sigh'd when I
compar'd 'em with one another, and had a thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>different thoughts which I know not what
to make of. <i>Cloridon</i> Addressing himself to my
Mother, <i>said</i>, Madam, I am come to beg a Favour
of you, which I should hardly have the Confidence
to ask, if the whole satisfaction of my life did not
depend upon it. My Mother told him, that she
could not refuse any thing to one whom she ow'd
so much to; and that she should think her self
happy if she could serve him in a thing which he
said concern'd him so nearly. He return'd some
Compliments, and then desir'd her to hear him
out with Patience, which she promis'd, and he
begun, I have a long time had a great Love and
Respect for your Daughter, and would have given
all the World to have seen her sometimes; but she
refus'd it me; and I bore her Rigour without
Murmuring, in hopes the time would come when
I could tell her I lov'd her without offending her
Virtue: But I can't live when I have lost that
hope, and therefore am come to beg you not to
marry <i>Olinda</i>, as I am told you design; and I will
make her Fortune greater than what she can expect
from <i>Orontes</i>. How, my Lord, <i>interrupted
my Mother</i>, what strange Proposition is this you
make me? Be not angry with me, or fear me, <i>continu'd
he</i>, for the moment you grant what I intreat
of you, I will leave you, and never desire to see
<i>Olinda</i> again, as long as I continue in the Condition
I am in; But 'twill be a great Happiness
for me to think, that she may one Day be mine;
and to be assur'd she will never be any others; and
if she be not chang'd, or that I am not much mistaken
in her, she will not be averse to it. He was
in the right, for though I was never an Enemy to
Marriage, yet I always preferr'd a single Life to it;
and I found enough of my stifled Flame revive
to make my Wishes comply with his. When my
Mother saw me much inclin'd to it, and knowing
I had only consented to marry <i>Orontes</i> in compliance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>of her; she began to think of it as a thing
might be done, but that she had given her Word
to <i>Orontes</i>, and could not go back from it. But
<i>Cloridon</i> told her, she need not be in any Fault in
that, if she wou'd but make use of the occasion
would be given her to break off with <i>Orontes</i> without
Examining further. She made some other
Objections, but he Answer'd them all, and upon
his Knees Swore, that if I Married <i>Orontes</i>, neither
he nor my Husband would survive it: So partly
out of fear of what might happen, and partly out
of inclination to oblige him, and willingness to
please me, my Mother consented. <i>Cloridon</i> begg'd
leave to talk with me, before he took his last leave,
which he did, and made me some little tender
Reproaches, for having resolv'd to Marry; which
I answer'd with a more reserv'd Kindness than I
had sometimes done; and that was the Subject of
many Letters he sent me since; for he often writes
to me. Two Days before we were to be Marry'd,
<i>Orontes</i> was to come to Town, which <i>Cloridon</i>
knew, and had provided half a dozen Soldiers
to seize upon him in the King's Name, (for
he was suspected for an Enemy to the Government.)
They did so, and told him they were
commanded to keep him a close Prisoner in a
House hard by, till further Order. He would fain
have Writ, but they would not let him, for they
said they had Orders to the contrary. There they
kept him a Week, and we wonder'd we heard nothing
of him, not knowing what methods were
us'd to hinder us; and to avoid seeing our Friends,
who would enquire the Reason, we thought it best
to retire hither, this being a private Place. When
<i>Cloridon</i> knew I was out of Town, he went himself
to free him, and told him things had been
misrepresented, and he had been wrong'd; but in
requital he would procure him any Employment
he would name; but he did not accept it. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>he came to enquire for me, no Body could tell him
where I was: But a Friend with whom I had left
such Orders, told him, that I had taken it so ill,
that he should slight me so far, as neither to
come, nor to send to me, in so long time, that
whatever he could say for himself, I wou'd never
forgive him, nor so much as hear him. He was
no doubt troubled at it, but he was not a Man to
take any thing much to Heart; and <i>Cloridon</i> knowing
he had not dealt very fairly by him, was very
desirous to oblige him some other way: And indeed
he did him a very considerable Service not
long after, for he was really accus'd privately to
the King of a Plot, which wou'd have cost him
his Life, if <i>Cloridon</i> had not taken a great deal of
pains to free him, more than he could have expected
in such a ticklish Affair as that; and had
like to become himself suspected by it: So that I
think he has been more his Friend in saving his
Life, than he was his Enemy in taking his Mistress
from him. This is, <i>Cleander</i>, the true Cause of
my Retirement, which is very agreeable to me,
whilst I hear often from you, and whilst <i>Cloridon</i>
continues to think of me. I have sent you a Copy
of Verses which he writ to me just after I came
hither.</p>

<p class="in"><i>Cloridon</i> has just sent me word that <i>Orontes</i> is
dead of the Small-Pox; so that I shall come to
Town sooner than I design'd. The expectation of
seeing you pleases me extreamly; for tho' I find a
great satisfaction in conversing with you by Letters;
yet 'tis not so full and perfect at this distance,
as when I am with you. I can't tell you my
Thoughts so well, nor know yours; a Question
suddenly started, or sometimes a Look, will discover
more to me than you know of your self;
and I would know you not as you seem to the
World, or what you think of your self, but what
you are; for though you are more sincere than other
Men, yet there is no Man but deceives the
World in some things, and himself in more;
and therefore to be a good Man, 'tis absolutely
necessary to have a true Friend; and
since you have made choice of me, I can only
attone for my want of other Qualifications, by
my Fidelity, which you may always rely upon.
Will not the World, when they see so tender, so
constant an Affection betwixt us, be convinced of
that receiv'd Error, that there can be no such intimacy
betwixt two of different Sexes without the
Passion of Love; In us I'm sure they can't suspect
it; when they see you have so much Love for
<i>Ambrisia</i>, and me so forward to promote its being
reciprocal. I wish it may have that Effect,
that the Women may no longer scruple to bestow
their Friendship upon a Worthy Man, for
fear of misconstructions; both Sexes will find
their Advantages by it. Yours is more capable to
instruct and form our Minds; than the wisest of
our own; and ours will be more apt to curb that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>Licentiousness, which Men usually encourage one
another in: And what happiness will it be for us
to see our selves the Instruments of all the Men's
becoming Good, and all the Women Wise? (A
more extraordinary Reformation than <i>Luther</i>'s.)
Let our Friendships then be so Exemplary, that all
may emulate, and wish to live like us; and by
endeavouring, find that there's a purer and more
solid Satisfaction one moment with a Friend, than
Ages thrown away upon the Gallantries, which
so take up the Hearts, and steal the Hours of our
Youth. Adieu <i>Cleander</i>, correct the Errors of my
Life with a gentle Hand of Friendship, and always
be as much my Friend as I am yours,</p>

that even that poor Comfort is deny'd me; for
who can I complain to, when in lamenting my
Misfortune I must expose our Crime: For yours
my Lord, has involv'd me in the guilt; and all
those thoughts and Actions, which were innocent
before, must be condemn'd as the Causes of such
ill Effects: For if I had never lov'd you, or if
I had never own'd it, nor consented to see you,
you had not desir'd any thing of me that could
shock my Virtue: Now, I can't think of 'em
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>without Shame and Anger. That Love which
shin'd before so Pure and Bright, appears now the
Blackest thing in Nature; and I hate my self for
not hating you; for I own (tho' I blush in owning)
that I love you still; Nay, I believe that I
forgive you too; but I must never, never see you
more: No, though you swear you Repent, and
that you would not repeat your Crime, if you
were certain of success. Would not you believe
I should as easily Pardon your breach of this Vow,
as I did the last, which you made me as solemnly?
Yes, you would, my Lord, and I should be betray'd
to things I never thought of yet: For all is solid,
convincing Reason that you speak; and I should
soon believe any thing you would have me.
Curse on that fond Credulity that first deceiv'd
me into a belief, that 'twas no Sin to love you.
Yet sure it could not be an unpardonable Fault,
to value one that so infinitely deserves it: To
Love, to See, and Talk with one whose Conversation
is so Charming as yours; and that was all
I wish'd. All that know you do the same; Why
then am I more guilty? Ah! If your Fame had
been as pure as mine, we had both been Happy and
Innocent; so innocent, that she, that happy she, who
claims all your love as her due, (even she, I think, if
she had known our Hearts) could not have been offended
at it: But who is there, the most uninterested,
that would not now condemn us; Nay,
the most Partial could not excuse us; even we
should blame our selves. Why will you then importune
me still to see you; ask me no more,
what I dare never grant; and believe&mdash;&mdash;but
you know, 'tis not unkindness makes me Refuse
you: You know I must be Wretched in your
Absence; yet think me easie and satisfied, if it
will contribute any thing to your quiet; or rather
don't think of me at all. Let us make our
selves as happy as we can; I will endeavour to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>forget you; don't Write to me, if you love me
well enough to forbear it: And if you can cease
to love me, without hating me; for I don't find
I have force enough to bear so great a misfortune,
which is the only one can add to the weight of
those which have already almost sunk</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
